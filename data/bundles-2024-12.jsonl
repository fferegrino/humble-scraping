A discrete lowpass filter can be either 12dB or 24dB per octave, for both a classic Oberheim 2-pole sound and the legendary Minimoog 4-pole sound. Notable users of the OB-1 were the composer and musician Vince Clarke and the bands Tangerine Dream, Rush, and The Grid.</p><p>The Yamaha CP-30 is an electronic piano from 1976 that uses analog synthesis sound generation. The CP-30 has a Decay control knob that can be used to simultaneously adjust attack and decay parameters not unlike those of a regular synthesizer's ADSR envelope. Two tone-generation systems, each with independent decay control, let users like Herbie Hancock, Fleetwood Mac and The Cars conjure up unique sounds using modern synthesizer techniques.</p><p>The combination of the Yamaha CP-30 and Oberheim OB-1 creates wonderfully spacious and timeless tonal possibilities. Electric piano, clavichord and harpsichord timbres from the CP-30 combine with the lush discrete analog oscillators and filters of the OB-1 layered in as dimensional pads and evolving sweeps.

Schwab</b>\n\n<b>\"Addictive and immersive, <i>A Gathering of Shadows </i>cements this series as a must-read.\" \u2014<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, grade A</b>\n\nFour months have passed since the shadow stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Rhy was wounded and the Dane twins fell, and the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift, and into Black London. \n\nIn many ways, things have almost returned to normal, though Rhy is more sober, and Kell is now plagued by his guilt. Restless, and having given up smuggling, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks like she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games-an extravagant international competition of magic, meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries-a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.\n\nBut while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life, and those who were thought to be forever gone have returned. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night reappears in the morning, and so it seems Black London has risen again-and so to keep magic's balance, another London must fall...in V.E.
