Later, facing what seemed like an insurmountable obstacle after reaching the pros, he overcame a devastating knee injury to leave an indelible mark on the sport.\n \nWhen his football career ended prematurely following the tragic death of the mother of his children, James made a seamless transition to become a successful businessman.

Replacing Hall of Famer Bill Cowher\u2014and two years removed from the team\u2019s Super Bowl XL victory\u2014there was immense pressure on the first-year head coach, who many fans and those in the media were largely unfamiliar with. After five seasons as an assistant for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a single season as the defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, the hiring came as a surprise to many. From his first day at the helm, numerous questions began to be asked: Was this young coach able to lead a veteran team that still had championship hopes? Could the newly hired, soft-spoken coach be able to fill the shoes of the great Cowher, known for being brash and outspoken? Was his hiring based solely on the \u201cRooney Rule\u201d\u2014named after Steelers owner Dan Rooney\u2014which states that every team must interview at least one minority candidate for their open head coaching position?\n \nNot only did Tomlin rise above the questions and criticism about his credentials, he continued the franchise\u2019s reputation of excellence. The youngest coach to win a Super Bowl in only his second season at the helm, Tomlin has yet to have a losing record in sixteen seasons with the team. He is also the second-most tenured head coach in the league, only behind Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots.\n \nBut the question still unanswered is, who is Mike Tomlin? Known for giving little to the media and keeping his thoughts and opinions private, those outside the locker room and Steelers offices know little about the future Hall of Fame coach. Even as one of the most successful African American head coaches in NFL history, and one that has handled numerous locker room \u201cpersonalities\u201d over the years, much of what is written and reported about the coach is only above the surface.

First distinguishing himself as a player with the Cleveland Browns (under the great Paul Brown), Baltimore Colts, and Washington Redskins, Donald Francis Shula went on to be the boy wonder of the NFL as a coach. After serving for three seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions, where he oversaw one of the NFL\u2019s toughest units, Shula was named the youngest head coach in NFL history when he took over the Baltimore Colts in 1963. But after public feuding with star quarterback Johnny Unitas and owner Carroll Rosenbloom, and despite leading the team to two NFL championship games, Shula accepted the job as head coach of the perennial doormat Miami Dolphins in 1970.</p><p>Within a few seasons, he took the Dolphins to three straight Super Bowls, winning twice, including the only undefeated Super Bowl championship season in 1972 behind a bruising running attack led by two 1,000 yard rushers, Larry Csonka and Mercury Morris, as well as the unheralded \u201cNo-Name Defense.\u201d Shula won more games (328) than any other coach in NFL history, led his teams to six Super Bowls, and only posted a losing record twice in thirty-three seasons on the sideline. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997.

Rather, he was a black bicycle racer named \u0093Major\u201d Taylor.</p><p>In his day, Taylor became a spiritual and athletic idol. He was the fastest man in America and a champion who prevailed over unspeakable cruelty. The men who aided him were among the most colorful to emerge from the era. When hotel and restaurant operators denied Taylor food and lodgings, forcing him to sleep in horse stables and to race hungry, there was a benevolent racer-turned-trainer named Birdie Munger, who took Taylor under his wing and into his home. Then along came Arthur Zimmerman, an internationally famous bike racer, who gently mentored Taylor when some riders drew the color line and refused to race against him. Taylor\u2019s manager, pugnacious Irishman and famed Broadway producer William Brady, stood up for him when track owners tried barring him from competition. From the Old World came a rakishly handsome, mustachioed sports promoter named Victor Breyer, who lured Taylor overseas for a dramatic, Seabiscuit versus War Admiral\u0096like match race that would be widely remembered a quarter century later.</p><p>With a foreword by World Champion and three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, this spellbinding saga of fortitude, grace, forgiveness, and a man\u2019s unyielding will to win against the greatest of odds is sure to become a classic that will be enjoyed by everyone.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Conrad Kerber; Terry Kerber"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "baseballgaijin_chasingadreamtojapanandback": {"human_name": "Baseball Gaijin: Chasing A Dream To Japan And Back", "machine_name": "baseballgaijin_chasingadreamtojapanandback", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Sports Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781683584780/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Like many American boys, Tony Barnette yearned to one day make it to \u201cThe Show,\u201d playing baseball professionally.

He did not know the language and was unfamiliar with Nippon Professional Baseball and essentially everything else. On his own in a strange land, the burning desire to one day make the major leagues never subsided. He knew the odds were against him, as less than one quarter of gaijin (Japanese for \u201cforeigner\u201d) ballplayers who go to Japan appear in the majors at any point thereafter.</p><p>First-year struggles led to multiple demotions and his end-of-year release. But when you\u2019re chasing a dream, you expect to encounter several obstacles. Tony refused to be deterred. Over six seasons in Japan, the starter became a reliever and then a closer. After a strong 2015 season, in which he guided his long-suffering Swallows to the Japan Series, he finally got the call he had been waiting for. Signing with the Texas Rangers in December, Tony would make his first major-league appearance on April 5, 2016, at age thirty-two.

It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba's <a> Entertainment Computing Laboratory </a> under the <a> Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship </a> . <br><br>After research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful <a> Kickstarter Campaign </a> allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety <a> here </a> . <br><br>Andrew Cross is infuriated! <br><br>For three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the \"SanjigenJiten,\" Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device's amazing capabilities at the world's largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International. <br><br>But while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted! <br><br>But Andrew Cross has a plan. He's made an even better version of his SanjigenJiten and launched an online campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to raise awareness of Technoglobe's blatant theft and prove his device really works! But does the SanjigenJiten really work? Can Andrew actually pull it off?!</p>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.74, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Mostly Positive", "steam_count": 858}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Rob Howland"}], "item_content_type": "game"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"preventcancerfoundation": {"machine_name": "preventcancerfoundation", "youtube_link": "KZw4XKncDgo", "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<em>Donations to support the Prevent Cancer Foundation&nbsp;are made to the&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183597\">PayPal Giving Fund</a>, subject to its policies.</em><br><br>Founded in 1985, the Prevent Cancer Foundation has been a leader in cancer prevention and early detection.&nbsp; As the only nonprofit in the United States solely focused on cancer prevention and early detection, the Foundation has been referred to as \"the candle that ignited a bonfire\" in the field of prevention.&nbsp; Investing more than $138 million over the past 29 years, the Prevent Cancer Foundation has always focused its resources on cancers that can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices or early detection.<br><br>Each year, more than 1.6 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer and more than 500,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp; However, research shows that up to 60 percent of cancer cases and more than 50 percent of cancer deaths are preventable - with the knowledge we have today.<br>The Foundation has spent the last three decades working for:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the cancer mortality rate by focusing on individual behaviors, engaging in public policy discussions and funding on prevention and early detection research.</li>\n<li>Raising awareness of all preventable cancers across all populations.</li>\n<li>Making prevention knowledge and early detection services more accessible for people in medically underserved communities.</li>\n<li>Collaborating with partners to maximize the effectiveness and reach of the prevention and early detection programs and message.</li>\n</ul>", "human_name": "Prevent Cancer Foundation", "developers": [{"developer-name": "www.preventcancer.org", "developer-url": "http://www.PreventCancer.org"}], "publishers": [], "user_ratings": {}}}}, "from_bundle": {"machine_name": "newyearsresolutionlearnnewskillencore_bundle", "tile_short_name": "New Year, New You: Communication & Meditation", "short_marketing_blurb": "Unlock your New Year\u2019s achievements", "marketing_blurb": "Get <em>Influent: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>PLAYNE : The Meditation Game</em>, <em>Nanotale - Typing Chronicles</em>, and more!", "detailed_marketing_blurb": "As you explore new languages with Influent\u2014and have fun in the process\u2014with this bundle of games designed to help you learn!
