Later, facing what seemed like an insurmountable obstacle after reaching the pros, he overcame a devastating knee injury to leave an indelible mark on the sport.\n \nWhen his football career ended prematurely following the tragic death of the mother of his children, James made a seamless transition to become a successful businessman.

Was his hiring based solely on the \u201cRooney Rule\u201d\u2014named after Steelers owner Dan Rooney\u2014which states that every team must interview at least one minority candidate for their open head coaching position?\n \nNot only did Tomlin rise above the questions and criticism about his credentials, he continued the franchise\u2019s reputation of excellence. The youngest coach to win a Super Bowl in only his second season at the helm, Tomlin has yet to have a losing record in sixteen seasons with the team. He is also the second-most tenured head coach in the league, only behind Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots.\n \nBut the question still unanswered is, who is Mike Tomlin? Known for giving little to the media and keeping his thoughts and opinions private, those outside the locker room and Steelers offices know little about the future Hall of Fame coach. Even as one of the most successful African American head coaches in NFL history, and one that has handled numerous locker room \u201cpersonalities\u201d over the years, much of what is written and reported about the coach is only above the surface. That\u2019s where John Harris comes in.\n \nA veteran journalist who covered Tomlin\u2019s hiring for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Harris works to pull back the curtain on the mystique behind this \u201ccoaching unicorn.\u201d Beginning with his days as a wide receiver at William &amp; Mary, his several years in the college coaching ranks, to getting hired by Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy with the Buccaneers and his single season with the Vikings, Tomlin shares how a young man from Hampton, Virginia, was able to establish himself as a leader of men in a business with so much turnover, earned the respect from his peers and players, and has continued to be someone that is looked up to by so many in the league.\n \nWith interviews from former players, coaches, and executives, Harris lets readers in on what it\u2019s like to play for Tomlin, why he is (or is not) beloved in Pittsburgh, and how his continued success has helped change the landscape of what NFL franchises look for in hiring a head coach. All from a man that chooses to give all the success to his players and coaches\u2014past and present\u2014than take it for himself: exactly what every franchise hopes for from the leader of their team.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "John Harris; Tony Dungy"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "warrenspahn_abiographyofthelegendarylefty": {"human_name": "Warren Spahn: A Biography Of The Legendary Lefty", "machine_name": "warrenspahn_abiographyofthelegendarylefty", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Sports Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781683582007/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>With 363 victories, Warren Spahn is the winningest left-handed pitcher in baseball history.

Though he never had the benefit of playing in the media spotlight of New York or Los Angeles, he remains the career leader in total bases, runs batted in, and All-Star selections; shares records for home runs by brothers (with Tommie Aaron) and by teammates (with Eddie Mathews); and is remembered with respect and admiration for his outspoken advocacy of civil rights for all minorities.\n \nWritten by a lifelong Braves fan who became a sportswriter, this book traces Aaron's odyssey from the segregated south to the baseball world revolutionized by Jackie Robinson, who became an early an important ally against bigotry and prejudice. It reveals how the New York Giants nearly beat the Boston Braves in signing Aaron, when the young slugger caught his first break, and why he changed his hitting style after the Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta. Though he never won a Triple Crown or hit for the cycle, he won virtually every major honor, including an MVP award, a World Series ring, and a berth in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

This is also a book of personal tragedy: the death of a child, a difficult divorce, and the stunning loss of the 43-year-old brother-in-law who became the first black GM. Not to mention the deluge of hate mail as it became obvious that he was approaching the most cherished record in sports.\n \nThrough it all, Henry Louis Aaron kept his composure, preferring to let his bat do the talking.

It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba's <a> Entertainment Computing Laboratory </a> under the <a> Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship </a> . <br><br>After research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful <a> Kickstarter Campaign </a> allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety <a> here </a> . <br><br>Andrew Cross is infuriated! <br><br>For three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the \"SanjigenJiten,\" Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device's amazing capabilities at the world's largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International. <br><br>But while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted! <br><br>But Andrew Cross has a plan. He's made an even better version of his SanjigenJiten and launched an online campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to raise awareness of Technoglobe's blatant theft and prove his device really works! But does the SanjigenJiten really work? Can Andrew actually pull it off?!</p>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.74, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Mostly Positive", "steam_count": 858}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Rob Howland"}], "item_content_type": "game"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"preventcancerfoundation": {"machine_name": "preventcancerfoundation", "youtube_link": "KZw4XKncDgo", "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<em>Donations to support the Prevent Cancer Foundation&nbsp;are made to the&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183597\">PayPal Giving Fund</a>, subject to its policies.</em><br><br>Founded in 1985, the Prevent Cancer Foundation has been a leader in cancer prevention and early detection.&nbsp; As the only nonprofit in the United States solely focused on cancer prevention and early detection, the Foundation has been referred to as \"the candle that ignited a bonfire\" in the field of prevention.&nbsp; Investing more than $138 million over the past 29 years, the Prevent Cancer Foundation has always focused its resources on cancers that can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices or early detection.<br><br>Each year, more than 1.6 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer and more than 500,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp; However, research shows that up to 60 percent of cancer cases and more than 50 percent of cancer deaths are preventable - with the knowledge we have today.<br>The Foundation has spent the last three decades working for:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the cancer mortality rate by focusing on individual behaviors, engaging in public policy discussions and funding on prevention and early detection research.</li>\n<li>Raising awareness of all preventable cancers across all populations.</li>\n<li>Making prevention knowledge and early detection services more accessible for people in medically underserved communities.</li>\n<li>Collaborating with partners to maximize the effectiveness and reach of the prevention and early detection programs and message.</li>\n</ul>", "human_name": "Prevent Cancer Foundation", "developers": [{"developer-name": "www.preventcancer.org", "developer-url": "http://www.PreventCancer.org"}], "publishers": [], "user_ratings": {}}}}, "from_bundle": {"machine_name": "newyearsresolutionlearnnewskillencore_bundle", "tile_short_name": "New Year, New You: Communication & Meditation", "short_marketing_blurb": "Unlock your New Year\u2019s achievements", "marketing_blurb": "Get <em>Influent: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>PLAYNE : The Meditation Game</em>, <em>Nanotale - Typing Chronicles</em>, and more!", "detailed_marketing_blurb": "As you explore new languages with Influent\u2014and have fun in the process\u2014with this bundle of games designed to help you learn!
