Each of the 23 available languages were being sold individually as DLC for $10 USD each. This was getting very complicated and difficult to manage with each new language released so instead of sticking with that forever, all languages are now bundled together in one simple package, effectively getting 20 additional languages for the price of three! All existing players who purchased at least one language pack are grandfathered in. All future language pack releases are given to owners of the bundle for free.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have plans to release more languages?

It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba's <a> Entertainment Computing Laboratory </a> under the <a> Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship </a> . <br><br>After research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful <a> Kickstarter Campaign </a> allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety <a> here </a> . <br><br>Andrew Cross is infuriated! <br><br>For three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the \"SanjigenJiten,\" Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device's amazing capabilities at the world's largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International. <br><br>But while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted! <br><br>But Andrew Cross has a plan. He's made an even better version of his SanjigenJiten and launched an online campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to raise awareness of Technoglobe's blatant theft and prove his device really works! But does the SanjigenJiten really work? Can Andrew actually pull it off?!</p>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.74, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Mostly Positive", "steam_count": 858}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Rob Howland"}], "item_content_type": "game"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"preventcancerfoundation": {"machine_name": "preventcancerfoundation", "youtube_link": "KZw4XKncDgo", "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<em>Donations to support the Prevent Cancer Foundation&nbsp;are made to the&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183597\">PayPal Giving Fund</a>, subject to its policies.</em><br><br>Founded in 1985, the Prevent Cancer Foundation has been a leader in cancer prevention and early detection.&nbsp; As the only nonprofit in the United States solely focused on cancer prevention and early detection, the Foundation has been referred to as \"the candle that ignited a bonfire\" in the field of prevention.&nbsp; Investing more than $138 million over the past 29 years, the Prevent Cancer Foundation has always focused its resources on cancers that can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices or early detection.<br><br>Each year, more than 1.6 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer and more than 500,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp; However, research shows that up to 60 percent of cancer cases and more than 50 percent of cancer deaths are preventable - with the knowledge we have today.<br>The Foundation has spent the last three decades working for:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the cancer mortality rate by focusing on individual behaviors, engaging in public policy discussions and funding on prevention and early detection research.</li>\n<li>Raising awareness of all preventable cancers across all populations.</li>\n<li>Making prevention knowledge and early detection services more accessible for people in medically underserved communities.</li>\n<li>Collaborating with partners to maximize the effectiveness and reach of the prevention and early detection programs and message.</li>\n</ul>", "human_name": "Prevent Cancer Foundation", "developers": [{"developer-name": "www.preventcancer.org", "developer-url": "http://www.PreventCancer.org"}], "publishers": [], "user_ratings": {}}}}, "from_bundle": {"machine_name": "newyearsresolutionlearnnewskillencore_bundle", "tile_short_name": "New Year, New You: Communication & Meditation", "short_marketing_blurb": "Unlock your New Year\u2019s achievements", "marketing_blurb": "Get <em>Influent: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>PLAYNE : The Meditation Game</em>, <em>Nanotale - Typing Chronicles</em>, and more!", "detailed_marketing_blurb": "As you explore new languages with Influent\u2014and have fun in the process\u2014with this bundle of games designed to help you learn!
