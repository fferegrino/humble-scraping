Steve and Alan Moore, proprietors of the celebrated Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels (sorcery by appointment since circa 150 AD), have produced a clear and practical grimoire of the occult sciences that offers endless necromantic fun for all the family. Exquisitely illuminated by a host of adepts including Kevin O\u2019Neill, John Coulthart, Steve Parkhouse, Rick Veitch, Melinda Gebbie, and Ben Wickey, this marvellous and unprecedented tome promises to provide all that the reader could conceivably need in order to commence a fulfilling new career as a diabolist. Its contents include profusely illustrated instructional essays upon this ancient sect\u2019s theories of magic, notably the key dissertation \u201cAdventures in Thinking,\u201d which gives reliable advice as to how entry into the world of magic may be readily achieved. Further to this, a number of \u201cRainy Day\u201d activity pages present lively and entertaining things to do once the magical state has been attained, including such popular pastimes as divination, etheric travel, and the conjuring of a colourful multitude of spirits, deities, dead people, and infernal entities from the pit, all of whom are sure to become your new best friends. Also contained within this extravagant compendium of thaumaturgic lore is a history of magic from the last ice age to the present day, told in a series of easy-to-absorb pictorial biographies of fifty great enchanters and complemented by a variety of picture stories depicting events ranging from the Palaeolithic origins of art, magic, language, and consciousness to the rib-tickling comedy exploits of Moon and Serpent founder Alexander the False Prophet (\u201cHe\u2019s fun, he\u2019s fake, he\u2019s got a talking snake!\u201d).

A full range of entertainments will be provided, encompassing such diverse novelties and pursuits as a lavishly decorated, decadent pulp tale of occult adventure recounted in the serial form. Completing this almost-unimaginable treasure trove is a lengthy thesis revealing the ultimate meaning of both the Moon and the Serpent in a manner that makes transparent the much-obscured secret of magic, happiness, sex, creativity, and the known Universe, while at the same time explaining why these lunar and ophidian symbols feature so prominently in the order\u2019s peculiar name.

Activist organizing meets government gridlock as a millennial New Yorker cartoonist follows a first-year senator on her unforgettable journey \u2014 from outsider to insider. In early 2018, cartoonist Sofia Warren was not paying attention to New York state politics. But that summer, her Brooklyn neighborhood began buzzing about Julia Salazar, a 27-year-old democratic socialist running for state senate whose grassroots campaign was inspiring an army of volunteers. When they beat the odds and won, Warren found herself wondering what would happen next. How does it work when an outsider who runs on revolutionary change has to actually do the job? So she decided to find out. Using the graphic memoir format, Radical: My Year with a Socialist Senator is a remarkable first-hand account of Warren\u2019s experience embedded with Julia Salazar and her staff during their first year in office. From candid conversations and eyewitness experiences, Warren builds a gripping and intimate portrait of a scrappy team of community organizers battling entrenched power structures, particularly to advance Julia\u2019s marquee issue of housing rights. At every key point during the year \u2014 setting up an office, navigating insider politics, public pushback, testy staff meetings, emotional speeches, protest marches, setbacks, and victories \u2014 Warren is up close and personal with Julia and her team, observing, questioning, and drawing, as they try to translate their ideals into concrete legislation. Along the way, Warren works toward answers to deeper questions: what makes a good leader? What does it mean to be a part of a community? Can democracy work? How can everyday people make change happen?

These encounters may be isolated or part of a Tale, a linked series of encounters where characters and conditions carry over from one fight to the next.</p><p>Designed to represent these smaller battles, Shieldbash can be played on a battlefield as small as 2\u2019x2\u2019, or across the decks of enemy ships at sea.</p><p>These desperate actions will be contested by the fighters of Agaptus. A fighter is usually a single warrior on a 20mm base, but it can also be a beast or group of lesser warriors. Defined by a few, simple attributes and abilities, each fighter is uniquely suited to his role on the battlefield, without bogging down the commander with unnecessary complication.</p><p>During a Round of battle each commander will take turns as the active commander. His opponent will draw a Stone for him on his turn, allowing him to assign Surges to his fighters. These Surges allow the fighters to perform actions, which include moving about the battlefield, attacking enemy fighters, or other tasks performed in pursuit of victory.</p><p>In addition, each commander has access to the resource Froth. Froth allows a commander to perform extra movement, modify a die roll, or execute other minor actions that enable him to bend the rules to his favor. However, the active commander\u2019s opponent must agree upon the expenditure of Froth, creating a dynamic of haggling and compromise.</p><p>Shieldbash includes rules for all of the figures from War of Ashes: Shieldwall as well as adding ranged troops, cavalry and two new factions: The True Atronians and the Ki-kak! We could go on and on explaining it, but how about we just give you the entire rules chapter for free?</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Strange Plastic", "developer-url": "https://www.strangeplastic.com/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "jotunnarcher1": {"human_name": "Jotunn Archer 1", "machine_name": "jotunnarcher1", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 25.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Varkan Iron Maw -

Infiltrate the tournaments they hold, and you can get close to their elite commanders. What you do once you get there will be up to you. Just remember, your decisions have consequences! <br><br>The core gameplay is deceptively simple: every turn you can play one warrior, and one support card, then all your units will advance towards the enemy and attack if they can! But the challenge comes in what combinations you choose, how you build your deck, and when you hold back cards for a better opportunity. Your opponents play by the same rules\u2026 most of the time. Each battle can have different rules or special features that can be exploited by smart deck building!<br><br>Warriors range from front line brutes to fragile archers and supporting spellcasters. Equipment cards buff warriors on the battlefield, while spells can aid your fighters or harm the enemy. There\u2019s no one way to play - build a deck that uses tough fighters with armor and healing to grind down your opponents, roll in with high damage archers and poison wielding bandits to put down enemy warriors before they can even react, and much more. With a huge range of cards to choose from, the number of possible combinations is enormous.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>EVERY BATTLE IS A NEW CHALLENGE! </strong> <br><br>Each battle in <i> Ash of Gods: The Way </i> is a carefully crafted test of your skills with different objectives and opponents. Whether you\u2019re capturing checkpoints, defending your commander from a deadly enemy or fighting a series of one on one duels you\u2019ll need all your wits about you to prevail. The outcome of every battle is significant!<br><br>Make sure to use every detail of the battlefield to your advantage. You\u2019ll encounter traps which can be a danger or an opportunity depending on your strategy, and power runes which could change the course of a battle entirely! <br><br>If your current tactics aren\u2019t working out, just switch out your cards and upgrades to try something different \u2014 there\u2019s no penalty for experimentation or changing strategy.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>CHOOSE YOUR WAY </strong> <br><br><i> Ash of Gods: The Way </i> is a novel genre mix of RPG style conversations, a collectible card game, and a turn-based tactical battle \u2014 your choices in all of these areas will influence the outcome of your story.<br><br>You build your deck in <i> Ash of Gods: The Way </i> with a combination of character cards and support cards. Your characters are deployed to the battlefield, while support cards boost your characters or cast powerful spells. Both types of card can be upgraded to become stronger, and characters can even gain brand new skills like cunning counter-attacks or armor smashing strikes.<br><br>Each card belongs to one of five distinct factions in the game, all with their own synergies and metagame strengths. Earn new cards by winning battles, buying them, or completing special tasks. You can mix and match faction cards as you wish, or focus on just one \u2014 it\u2019s your call \u2014 your way. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>INTERACTIVE STORY WITH MULTIPLE ENDINGS </strong> <br><br>The story centers on young Finn who is sent on a dangerous mission that could stop a murderous war\u2026 but on his journey he'll learn that some of his enemies are quite different from what he\u2019s been told. There will be hard decisions to make and Finn will have to live with the consequences. In addition to the non-linear main plot, told through (fully voice acted) cutscenes and conversations, there are also side quests to explore.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>EXPLORE OTHER GAMES IN THE ASH OF GODS UNIVERSE! </strong> <br><br><i> Ash of Gods: The Way </i> is our second game in the Ash of Gods universe \u2014 our first game, <i> Ash of Gods: Redemption </i> is a turn-based RPG with tactical combat, CCG elements and a heavily interactive story with major decisions to make which are literally life or death.

Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.<br><br>Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge.

It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

The ideas can be used in a variety of ways. A gamemaster can roll randomly on a table or select ideas based on their preference. The ideas can be springboards to new campaigns or side quests or storylines that are weaved into an existing campaign. The ideas can be used as-is or mashed together to suit gamemasters\u2019 needs. The tables of ideas are Curses, Deserts, Disasters, Dragons, Dwarves, Fighter Guild, Ghosts, Halflings, Mountains, and War. Each table is developed around a general controlling idea to help gamemasters determine what ideas are appropriate for their campaigns or sessions.

Preparing RPG campaigns and sessions can be taxing, and sometimes a spark is needed to light the creative fires. DMs and GMs always need clever hooks and stories to launch their players on fantastic adventures. These quest and adventure ideas can be used in a couple of different ways. First, they can be used as the main objective of a campaign. Second, they can be used as side quests or rumors during a larger campaign. To help use the ideas in either of these ways, the quests range from simple to complex. This range gives DMs flexibility in crafting sessions. The adventure ideas have been arranged in random tables so dungeon masters can roll percentile dice to discover quests. The element of randomness in tabletop RPGs often brings out the most fascinating and engaging stories. As game masters and players add to the seed provided, unique tales emerge. The quests are categorized by different themes: Apocalyptic, Espionage, Fey, Gnome, Maps, Messages, Quest Givers, Ranger, Sky, and Thieves Guild. Death and destruction reign in the Apocalyptic section. Gear up for spy action with the Espionage quests. Journey in the fair country with ideas in the Fey table. Spent some time with the little folk exploring the Gnome quests. In the Maps table, game masters can give their players a unique map that leads to high adventure. The Messages section provides special deliveries for hints and clues characters need. People need jobs done and one hundred of those people are found in the Quest Givers section. Rangers got to range with the variety of quests on the next table. Take to the skies with Sky quests. Get sneaky with quests suited for the Thieves Guild.

Science fiction characters got to have skills. The Fields of Study section has two tables of engineering fields. These can be used as occupations for non-player characters, skills for player characters, or to add flavor to the setting. The final section is Space.
