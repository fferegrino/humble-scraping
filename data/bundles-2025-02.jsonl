Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

The ideas can be used in a variety of ways. A gamemaster can roll randomly on a table or select ideas based on their preference. The ideas can be springboards to new campaigns or side quests or storylines that are weaved into an existing campaign. The ideas can be used as-is or mashed together to suit gamemasters\u2019 needs. The tables of ideas are Curses, Deserts, Disasters, Dragons, Dwarves, Fighter Guild, Ghosts, Halflings, Mountains, and War. Each table is developed around a general controlling idea to help gamemasters determine what ideas are appropriate for their campaigns or sessions.

Preparing RPG campaigns and sessions can be taxing, and sometimes a spark is needed to light the creative fires. DMs and GMs always need clever hooks and stories to launch their players on fantastic adventures. These quest and adventure ideas can be used in a couple of different ways. First, they can be used as the main objective of a campaign. Second, they can be used as side quests or rumors during a larger campaign. To help use the ideas in either of these ways, the quests range from simple to complex. This range gives DMs flexibility in crafting sessions. The adventure ideas have been arranged in random tables so dungeon masters can roll percentile dice to discover quests. The element of randomness in tabletop RPGs often brings out the most fascinating and engaging stories. As game masters and players add to the seed provided, unique tales emerge. The quests are categorized by different themes: Apocalyptic, Espionage, Fey, Gnome, Maps, Messages, Quest Givers, Ranger, Sky, and Thieves Guild. Death and destruction reign in the Apocalyptic section. Gear up for spy action with the Espionage quests. Journey in the fair country with ideas in the Fey table. Spent some time with the little folk exploring the Gnome quests. In the Maps table, game masters can give their players a unique map that leads to high adventure. The Messages section provides special deliveries for hints and clues characters need. People need jobs done and one hundred of those people are found in the Quest Givers section. Rangers got to range with the variety of quests on the next table. Take to the skies with Sky quests. Get sneaky with quests suited for the Thieves Guild.

Science fiction characters got to have skills. The Fields of Study section has two tables of engineering fields. These can be used as occupations for non-player characters, skills for player characters, or to add flavor to the setting. The final section is Space.
