The underdark is far more than just dungeons and caves. It is a veritable underground continent, populated by advanced civilizations, ancient ruins, sunless seas, alien magic, bizarre creatures, and the horrid denizens of the gloom. The standards of the surface world hold no sway in the underdark, and its mysteries, ferocity, and danger will challenge even the hardiest of adventurers.</p><p>This book includes everything you need to create a compelling underdark world. Underdark adventures are easy to integrate with an existing campaign, as the very nature of the underdark lends itself to layering - simply arrange for the discovery of a subterranean portal, and the land beneath your existing campaign has a new life.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is divided into four chapters:</p><p>- The first chapter examines the characters of the underdark, especially among the most populous races: the drow, duergar, derro, svirfneblin, and troglodytes. This section defines the most renowned traits of these races with a variety of new prestige classes, then concludes with new equipment, feats, and skill applications useful to everyone. You can use this section to flesh out the enemies your PCs will face, or apply them to the stats for these underdark races found in the MM and DMG to use them as player characters.</p><p>- Chapter two introduces a variety of new monsters suitable to life in the underdark.</p><p>- Chapter three provides guidelines for creating an underdark campaign. These are mostly for inspiration - a collection of keywords and ideas that can help you get started on a new campaign, or tie together elements of an existing one.</p><p>- The book concludes with chapter four, which describes several points of interest in great detail. These cities, camps, and other locations can be dropped into your own campaign as needed, or inserted in their totality as an already-defined area.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is a stand-alone book. It can be used in conjunction with the Aerial Adventure Guide, or used independently.

From aerial assaults to haunted bridges, From Here to There turns \"getting there\" into a lot more fun! Covering levels 2 to 13, this compilation has a place in every campaign.</p><p>This adventure compilation includes the following great adventures:</p><p>- The Quick and the Dead (level 12), by Aeryn Rudel: While en route to their next adventure, the PCs pass through a thick copse of trees and are ambushed by a group of quickling muggers. The quicklings, however, do not attack to kill; instead, the little fey attempt to snatch a valuable item from each PC and then race off into the forest!</p><p>- When Madness Seeps Through (level 5), by Philippe-Antoine \"\"ChattyDM\"\" Menard: While traveling from a nearby town to their destination, the PCs spot a group of aberrant humanoids running across the road, each clutching struggling humans who call for help. Chasing the humanoids or following their trail deeper in the forest, the PCs find a forgotten temple occupied by the corrupted remnants of cultists.</p><p>- The Deadly Blue Yonder (level 13), by Brandes Stoddard: A group of evil cultists discovered a nest of wyvern eggs, and when those eggs hatched the cultists trained the wyverns as mounts. They have used this remarkable advantage to establish a dominion over the local countryside. As the PCs pass through their territory, they must defend themselves against aerial attack!</p><p>- The Toll Station (level 6), by Adrian Pommier: While passing through a toll station, the PCs are beset by nightmare creatures pulled from the imprisoned minds of the road wardens. To awaken the sleeping guardsmen and end the attacks, the PCs must smash a profane idol and defeat a demon of the Nightmare Goddess!</p><p>- The Crossing (level 4), by Chris Dias: The PCs are traveling near a river or through mountainous terrain when they find themselves in a thick fog. As they venture further, they come to a bridge. With no sign of alternate routes, they must make their way across. The bridge is an illusion generated by a predatory monster called a chosis mimic - a psychic creature that feeds on the life spirit of those traveling near it. The illusionary bridge has no beginning and no end, and no matter how long the PCs travel, they never reach its end before they reach theirs - unless they destroy the chosis mimic!</p><p>- The Hanging Tree (level 5), by Lee Hammock: The village of Tarrow has been using a local hanging tree to execute criminals for centuries, but now an innocent man has been added to its roster of the dead. The spirits of those previously killed on the tree have now risen up in a quest for vengeance, making travel through the area very difficult. After escaping from the undead raised by the hanging tree, the players reach Tarrow and discover why the spirits of the tree are restless by talking to the locals.</p><p>- Flying High (level 2), by Colleen Simpson: The PCs are en route to their next adventure, traveling through a lightly wooded hilly area, when they are swooped upon by steelwing hippogriffs, which attempt to carry one or more PCs to their nest site. When the PCs arrive at the nest area, they observe kobolds attacking the steelwing hippogriff nests. The steelwing hippogriffs need the assistance of the heroes!</p><p>- Mystery at the Wandering Wineskin Inn (level 5), by Ken McCutchen: The adventurers are resting comfortably at an inn. When the sun rises on a new day, the characters discover that one of the party members is missing! There are several items out of place in the room, and a search reveals several interesting clues. To locate the missing character, the party must gain knowledge about the missing companion, overcome misdirection from false allies, and defeat the brigands who are holding the missing character for ransom.</p><p>- The Hunting Party (level 2), by Brandes Stoddard: In the wilds, the PCs encounter a large group of goblins. The normally aggressive creatures recognize that the PCs carry their weapons with experience and skill, and they are reluctant to engage a foe who could cost them many of their own hunters and foragers. They even go so far as to buy off the PCs with a side of boar meat or venison from a recent kill.</p><p>Rules Set: 4E</p><p>Developer: Harley Stroh</p><p>Writers: Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, Harley Stroh</p><p>Cover Artist: David Griffith</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, and Harley Stroh"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "dungeoncrawlclassics_issue10_thesunlessgarden": {"human_name": "Dungeon Crawl Classics #10: The Sunless Garden", "machine_name": "dungeoncrawlclassics_issue10_thesunlessgarden", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Goodman Games", "publisher-url": "https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-10-the-sunless-garden/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>An Adventure for Character Levels 6-8!</p><p>Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was the dragon on the 20th level?

On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.</p><p>Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard - and the heretical Theophages - are lost to antiquity.</p><p>But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.</p><p>Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand. Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or - like so many others before - will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?</p><p>The boxed set is bursting with the puzzles, foes, and magic only found in a DCC RPG adventure. Inside you will find the God Eaters' grand alchymical experiment, with its spinning alembic and rotating elemental spheres. This takes the form of a large game board, approximately 17\"\" x 22\"\", with four separate spinning maps that attach to the board. An adventure booklet of 112 pages provides hitherto unknown monsters, perils, and traps. These lurk in the forgotten corridors, certain to bring a quick end to overconfident explorers.</p><p>Players will have the opportunity to study and manipulate the fabled Alembic Key, a relic rife with Theophagic sigils and zodiac signs. But beware, foolhardy reavers! Rotating the key spins the dungeon, transforming the PCs and altering reality itself! Left in the hands of a fidgety player, it could easily spell the end of the multiverse. This physical prop is composed of two spinning dials and is used by players during the adventure.</p><p>And as befitting DCC #100, the adventure is replete with player handouts in the form of a 28-page booklet containing over 40 illustrations of the Alembic, its elemental spheres, and the terrors lurking within the dark halls, as well as the infamous Sheaves of Chaos.</p><p>Finally, any adventure is only as good as the judge running it. Music of the Spheres is Chaos was designed with the judge in mind. The boxed set includes the Bookmark of 4 Parts - a tool for referencing the PCs' own changes.</p><p>This Boxed Set includes:</p><p>- Adventure Booklet (112 pages)</p><p>- Player Handout Booklet (28 pages and more than 40 illustrations)</p><p>- Large 17\" x 22\" Gameboard and four separate Spinning Maps</p><p>- Double-sided bookmark of 4 Parts (to track changes imposed by the Spinning Map)</p><p>- Alembic Key prop (used by players to spin the dungeon!)</p><p>- 3 Sheaves of Chaos handouts</p><p>With its many unique components, Music of the Spheres is Chaos captures all the magic and wonder that you've come to expect from a DCC RPG adventure. But fans familiar with Harley Stroh's work in Legacy of the Savage Kings, Sailors on the Starless Sea, and his many other adventures will know that our adventures are always far more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>You won't mistake this dungeon for any other adventure, anywhere, ever.</p><p>Be sure to check out our complete coverage of DCC #100 The Music of the Spheres is Chaos on www.goodman-games.com!
