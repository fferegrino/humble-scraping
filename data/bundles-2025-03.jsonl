Summon over 1200 different creatures and travel through randomly generated dungeons to acquire resources, new creatures, and loot. <br><br>If you\u2019re looking to compare <i>Siralim Ultimate</i> to other games, you might think of it as Pokemon meets Diablo, or more accurately, Dragon Warrior Monsters meets Path of Exile. <br><br><i>Siralim Ultimate</i> is a really, really, <i> really </i> big game. For that reason, this store description is extremely detailed to help you get a grip on exactly what you can expect from the game. If you're not up to read it all, though, here's a quick rundown of some of the main features: <br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>1200+ creatures to collect</li>\n<li>Fuse your creatures together - the offspring inherits its parents\u2019 stats, traits, and even the way they look!</li>\n<li>Randomly generated dungeons spanning 30 unique tilesets</li>\n<li>Customize your castle with thousands of different decorations</li>\n<li>Engage in strategic 6v6 battles</li>\n<li>Craft Artifacts and Spell Gems for your creatures</li>\n<li>Choose from one of 40 specializations for your character and earn perks that change the way your creatures fight in battle</li>\n<li>Insane amount of post-story content that will keep you engaged for thousands of hours (yes, really!)</li>\n</ul>\n<br>For the last century, the kingdoms of Nex and Siralim have enjoyed a prosperous alliance fueled by generous trade, unbiased distribution of territory, and a common goal to make the lands of Rodia safe for its inhabitants. Together, the two kingdoms have grown to become the most powerful in the world. But as we all know, power can corrupt even the most virtuous of souls. <br><br>As the ruler of Siralim, you just received word that King Lucius of Nex has obtained the Ultimate Nether Orb - a powerful relic that can be used to control the gods themselves. Worse yet, Lucius intends to manipulate the gods to aid him in conquering Siralim. You are left with no choice but to wage war on Nex and take back the Ultimate Nether Orb so that it will not be used for ill purposes. <br><br>In <i>Siralim Ultimate</i>, you\u2019ll encounter over 1200 different creatures. Each creature has a unique stat spread, as well as a unique trait. And don't worry - none of these creatures are re-skins or re-colors! <br><br>A trait is a passive effect that affects that creature\u2019s battle capabilities. For example, the Firewound Angel\u2019s \u201cPyre\u201d trait greatly increases the amount of damage it deals with basic attacks, and its attacks also afflict the target with the \u201cBurning\u201d debuff which causes damage over time. <br><br>Most creatures are obtained by encountering and defeating them in the wild. Afterward, you\u2019ll be able to summon them and use them in your party. Other creatures are obtained as quest rewards or by participating in various in-game activities. <br><br>Players can fuse their creatures together. The offspring inherits the stat spreads of both parents, as well as its parents\u2019 traits. In addition, the offspring will take on the physical appearance of both of its parents. There are over a million possible combinations, ensuring that no two players will have the same team! <br><br>In <i>Siralim Ultimate</i>, you\u2019ll spend most of your time adventuring through randomly generated dungeons called Realms. There are 30 different tilesets for these Realms, and each one offers different creatures to collect, items to find, and secrets to uncover. <br><br>When you enter a Realm, you\u2019ll also receive a randomly generated Realm Quest. These quests are short, bite-sized objectives that reward players with treasure upon completion. <br><br>Players can collect thousands of different decorations to adorn their castle. You can also change the floor and wall styles, and even unlock different songs that can be played in your castle. <br><br>You can also take on Projects to unlock new castle features, such as a battle arena, mini-games, and much more. <br><br>Battles are turn-based and pit your six creatures against six enemy creatures. Each creature takes a turn in a certain order that is determined by their Speed stat. <br><br>During a creature\u2019s turn, they can do any of the following: <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack: deals damage to the target based on the attacker\u2019s Attack stat.</li>\n<li>Cast: choose from one of the creature\u2019s equipped spells to devastate your enemies or boost the strength of your party.</li>\n<li>Defend: drastically reduces the amount of damage the creature will take until the start of its next turn.</li>\n<li>Provoke: enemies will be forced to target the creature until the start of its next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>These actions all interact with your creatures\u2019 traits as well. For example, one trait might cause a creature to deal damage to all enemies after it Defends. <br><br>After you win a battle, your creatures will gain experience points. In addition, you\u2019ll receive resources (currency) and maybe even some items. <br><br>At the start of the game, players can choose from one of 40 different specializations for their character. Each specialization offers a unique list of unlockable perks that change the way your creatures fight in battle. <br><br>Here is a list of just a few of the specializations in the game, along with a brief description of how they work: <br><br>Animator - As an Animator, you will always have a unique creature in your party called Animatus. Your entire battle strategy will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat. <br><br>Cabalist - As a Cabalist, you'll enable your creatures to cast spells that they normally wouldn't have access to. While other people's creatures might run out of Spell Gem Charges, you'll be able to keep your creatures well-stocked with fresh Spell Gems at the start of every battle. <br><br>Cleric - As a Cleric, you'll specialize in healing abilities, as well as buffing, resurrection, stat-boosting effects, and providing your creatures with protective barriers. Your creatures will be extremely difficult to kill. <br><br>Defiler - As a Defiler, you'll specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures. <br><br>Druid - As a Druid, you'll probably only want to have one (or two, later on) creatures in your party. Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party. <br><br>Evoker - As an Evoker, you'll empower your creatures' spellcasting capabilities. Your creatures will be able to cast the same spell multiple times in one turn, and these spells will be much stronger than if they had cast them without your guidance. <br><br>Hell Knight - As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights empower their creatures' attacks with chaotic magic. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well. <br><br>Inquisitor - As an Inquisitor, you'll have a solution at your disposal for every problem you encounter. In addition, Inquisitors are able to use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them. <br><br>Monk - As a Monk, you'll boost your creatures' chance to Dodge attacks and spells. When your creatures Dodge, they'll unleash a devastating counter-attack on the enemy. <br><br>Necromancer - As a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats, debuff enemies, and much more. <br><br>Paladin - As a Paladin, your creatures will be able to endure even the most powerful of attacks. Each time your creatures take damage, they'll also damage their enemies. <br><br>Reaver - As a Reaver, your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battles continue to drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll be able to devastate your enemies. <br><br>Sorcerer - As a Sorcerer, you'll support your creatures by debilitating their enemies from afar. Generally, your enemies won't be able to act for the first few turns in battle as long as you're around. <br><br>Tribalist - As a Tribalist, you'll want to assemble a party of creatures that belong to the same race. This will provide them with significant benefits that are exacerbated by their racial synergies with each other. <br><br>Trickster - As a Trickster, you'll heavily inconvenience your enemies by preventing them from taking action. You'll also gain the ability to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again. <br><br>Eventually, you can unlock all of these specializations on the same save file and quickly swap to them whenever you want. <br><br>Each of your creatures can equip an Artifact. Artifacts provide your creatures with various bonuses, including stat boosts, on-damage effects/procs, traits, and even the ability to automatically cast spells when certain conditions are met. <br><br>In order to obtain an Artifact, you must first forge one at the Blacksmith. After that, you can socket your Artifacts with crafting materials to add new properties to them. There are over 1000 crafting materials to be found, and they all provide different properties. You can upgrade your Artifacts to unlock new socket slots, and even brand your Artifacts to give them a custom name. <br><br>Your creatures can equip Spell Gems which allows them to cast the spell contained within the gem. There are more than 600 different spells for players to find. <br><br>In order to obtain Spell Gems, you must first find an Inscription that acts as a recipe to teach you how to craft the Spell Gem. You can upgrade your Spell Gems to unlock Enchantment Slots, and then you can use these slots to add properties that affect the way the spell works. <br><br>For example, you can add a modifier to a Spell Gem that allows it to deal damage to an additional enemy. Another interesting property is called \u201cMagnetic\u201d, which causes the spell to be more powerful for each creature in your party that has that same spell equipped. <br><br>Unlike other games, <i>Siralim Ultimate</i> allows you to decide when you\u2019ve finished it. For that reason, we\u2019ve packed the game with a ridiculous amount of content to explore, items to collect, achievements to earn, and so much more. Many players have enjoyed the previous Siralim games for thousands of hours (that's not an exaggeration) and <i>Siralim Ultimate</i> is even larger in scale. There will always be something new for you to collect, no matter how long you\u2019ve been playing! <br><br>Each of the 30 realms in <i>Siralim Ultimate</i> is ruled by a different god. Players can earn Favor with these gods to increase their Favor Rank. As your Favor Rank with each god increases, you\u2019ll be able to earn new items, creatures, decorations, and much more. <br><br>Almost every gameplay system in <i>Siralim Ultimate</i> is meant to last players forever - or at least for a very, very long time. For example, your creatures do not have a level cap, so you can continue to level them up and make them stronger indefinitely. Similarly, enemies can scale infinitely as well. <br><br>Post-story content is filled to the brim with countless activities for you to partake in to make your creatures more powerful. Here are a few examples: <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Take on randomly generated side quests to obtain unique creatures and items.</li>\n<li>Draft a team of creatures in the arena and see how many battles you can last before your final creature falls.</li>\n<li>Battle against the gods themselves! These super boss-style fights are among the most challenging in the game\u2026 but also the most rewarding.</li>\n<li>Unlock the relics of the gods and upgrade them indefinitely to unleash devastating powers upon your foes.</li>\n<li>Encounter Rodian Creature Masters in Realms. Defeat them to earn Mastery, items, achievements, and much more!</li>\n<li>Work with five different guilds to take on powerful False Gods.</li>\n<li>Collect skins and accessories for your creatures to customize their appearance.</li>\n<li>Collect cards to unlock permanent bonuses for all your creatures. There's a card for nearly every creature in the game!</li>\n<li>Collect Nether Stones, which are Diablo-inspired, randomly generated items that can be socketed into your Artifacts to grant them unimaginable power.</li>\n<li>Partake in mini-games such as slot machines, keno, scratch cards, and even a board game that rewards you with exclusive items.</li>\n<li>Defeat enemies to gain Knowledge about them, unlocking additional benefits when you next encounter that creature in the wild.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>The list goes on and on and on, but the point is, <i>Siralim Ultimate</i> isn\u2019t a game where you\u2019ll finish the main storyline and then call it quits.

It\u2019s a ragged old Rig that\u2019s seen better days, but it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Upgrade your ship to extend its range, reach new locations and turn it from a hovel to a home.</p>\n<p>Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you\u2019ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the work that\u2019ll keep you flying. From temporary contractors to new residents of the Rig, each of these characters has their own story, skills and troubles. Choose carefully.</p>\n<p>Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt\u2019s many hubs. These high-risk jobs each have their own challenges. From exploring treacherous derelicts and risky heists, to asteroid surveying and ship repair, you\u2019ll need to make the most of your skills, crew and resources to complete the contract and get paid.<br><br>Soon after escaping from your corporate overlords, you fell under the control of a local criminal gang and its leader, Laine. Now, after a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.<br><br>Each character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability, upgradable and customisable, that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success. Each class offers different tactical possibilities.<br><br>Nothing in the Belt ever runs smooth, including your artificial body. Citizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.<br><br>Contracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.<br><br>The Starward Belt offers a bigger, more varied world than the original game. Instead of living on a single station, you'll chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.<br><br>Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.<br><strong><br>ABOUT THE DEVELOPER<br></strong>Jump Over the Age is a one-person game development studio founded by Gareth Damian Martin (they/them).

Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.<br><br>Inspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, <i>Citizen Sleeper</i> uses Dice, Clocks and Drives to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock! <br><br>The station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future. <br><br>Eventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station\u2019s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station\u2019s networks. <br><br>Essen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity\u2019s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom. <br><i><br>Citizen Sleeper</i> uses Dice, Clocks and Drives to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. <br><br>Each cycle you roll your dice. Assign them to vast range of actions available on the station. With every action, choose what, and who, matters to you, shaping the lives of those around you, and ultimately the future of the station. <br><br>Clocks track both your actions and the actions of others across the station. From becoming a local at the Overlook Bar to protecting a friend from Yatagan enforcers, clocks allow you to track your own progress and the influence you have on the world around you. <br><br>Follow drives not quests, allowing you to pick and choose the stories and activities that matter to you. As you do, you will shape your character's five skills (Engineer, Interface, Endure, Intuit and Engage), unlocking perks and bonuses that reflect and change how you choose to live in this world. <br><i><br>Citizen Sleeper</i> now includes all three post-launch DLC episodes FLUX, REFUGE and PURGE, which expand the game and introduce additional characters and locations to Erlin\u2019s Eye in an exciting new late game storyline.<strong><br></strong><strong><br>ABOUT THE DEVELOPER</strong><br>Jump Over the Age is a one-person game development studio founded by Gareth Damian Martin (they/them).

Blending together traditional and all-new role-playing elements on top of a classless system offering nearly unlimited character development options, <i>Broken Roads</i> presents players with an original morality system: the Moral Compass.

Guided by the subconscious desires of its progenitor, an ikiryo acts where the person does not, free of its creator\u00eds inhibitions, morals, and reservations.

Readers could complete the map, send in their associated adventure proposal, and compete for a $1,000 contract to write that adventure. A panel of distinguished judges read the flood of proposals, and finally whittled the field down to a handful of contenders. After lengthy debate, a winner was chosen.</p><p>This adventure is the winner of the Mystery Map Adventure Design Competition. There were many great submissions to the competition, but Jobe Bittman's stood out above them all. This adventure has a strong Appendix N theme, unique encounters that your players will remember for a long time, many highly visual scenes that will stand out in your players' minds, and some terrific twists and turns.

The underdark is far more than just dungeons and caves. It is a veritable underground continent, populated by advanced civilizations, ancient ruins, sunless seas, alien magic, bizarre creatures, and the horrid denizens of the gloom. The standards of the surface world hold no sway in the underdark, and its mysteries, ferocity, and danger will challenge even the hardiest of adventurers.</p><p>This book includes everything you need to create a compelling underdark world. Underdark adventures are easy to integrate with an existing campaign, as the very nature of the underdark lends itself to layering - simply arrange for the discovery of a subterranean portal, and the land beneath your existing campaign has a new life.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is divided into four chapters:</p><p>- The first chapter examines the characters of the underdark, especially among the most populous races: the drow, duergar, derro, svirfneblin, and troglodytes. This section defines the most renowned traits of these races with a variety of new prestige classes, then concludes with new equipment, feats, and skill applications useful to everyone. You can use this section to flesh out the enemies your PCs will face, or apply them to the stats for these underdark races found in the MM and DMG to use them as player characters.</p><p>- Chapter two introduces a variety of new monsters suitable to life in the underdark.</p><p>- Chapter three provides guidelines for creating an underdark campaign. These are mostly for inspiration - a collection of keywords and ideas that can help you get started on a new campaign, or tie together elements of an existing one.</p><p>- The book concludes with chapter four, which describes several points of interest in great detail. These cities, camps, and other locations can be dropped into your own campaign as needed, or inserted in their totality as an already-defined area.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is a stand-alone book. It can be used in conjunction with the Aerial Adventure Guide, or used independently.

Set into the rocky cliff at the far side of the ledge stands a great stone archway sealed by an imposing door. Blue bolts of lightning ripple silently across the door's face, hinting at magical wards or seals. In the center of the door are three circular dials set one inside the next.

From aerial assaults to haunted bridges, From Here to There turns \"getting there\" into a lot more fun! Covering levels 2 to 13, this compilation has a place in every campaign.</p><p>This adventure compilation includes the following great adventures:</p><p>- The Quick and the Dead (level 12), by Aeryn Rudel: While en route to their next adventure, the PCs pass through a thick copse of trees and are ambushed by a group of quickling muggers. The quicklings, however, do not attack to kill; instead, the little fey attempt to snatch a valuable item from each PC and then race off into the forest!</p><p>- When Madness Seeps Through (level 5), by Philippe-Antoine \"\"ChattyDM\"\" Menard: While traveling from a nearby town to their destination, the PCs spot a group of aberrant humanoids running across the road, each clutching struggling humans who call for help. Chasing the humanoids or following their trail deeper in the forest, the PCs find a forgotten temple occupied by the corrupted remnants of cultists.</p><p>- The Deadly Blue Yonder (level 13), by Brandes Stoddard: A group of evil cultists discovered a nest of wyvern eggs, and when those eggs hatched the cultists trained the wyverns as mounts. They have used this remarkable advantage to establish a dominion over the local countryside. As the PCs pass through their territory, they must defend themselves against aerial attack!</p><p>- The Toll Station (level 6), by Adrian Pommier: While passing through a toll station, the PCs are beset by nightmare creatures pulled from the imprisoned minds of the road wardens. To awaken the sleeping guardsmen and end the attacks, the PCs must smash a profane idol and defeat a demon of the Nightmare Goddess!</p><p>- The Crossing (level 4), by Chris Dias: The PCs are traveling near a river or through mountainous terrain when they find themselves in a thick fog. As they venture further, they come to a bridge. With no sign of alternate routes, they must make their way across. The bridge is an illusion generated by a predatory monster called a chosis mimic - a psychic creature that feeds on the life spirit of those traveling near it. The illusionary bridge has no beginning and no end, and no matter how long the PCs travel, they never reach its end before they reach theirs - unless they destroy the chosis mimic!</p><p>- The Hanging Tree (level 5), by Lee Hammock: The village of Tarrow has been using a local hanging tree to execute criminals for centuries, but now an innocent man has been added to its roster of the dead. The spirits of those previously killed on the tree have now risen up in a quest for vengeance, making travel through the area very difficult. After escaping from the undead raised by the hanging tree, the players reach Tarrow and discover why the spirits of the tree are restless by talking to the locals.</p><p>- Flying High (level 2), by Colleen Simpson: The PCs are en route to their next adventure, traveling through a lightly wooded hilly area, when they are swooped upon by steelwing hippogriffs, which attempt to carry one or more PCs to their nest site. When the PCs arrive at the nest area, they observe kobolds attacking the steelwing hippogriff nests. The steelwing hippogriffs need the assistance of the heroes!</p><p>- Mystery at the Wandering Wineskin Inn (level 5), by Ken McCutchen: The adventurers are resting comfortably at an inn. When the sun rises on a new day, the characters discover that one of the party members is missing! There are several items out of place in the room, and a search reveals several interesting clues. To locate the missing character, the party must gain knowledge about the missing companion, overcome misdirection from false allies, and defeat the brigands who are holding the missing character for ransom.</p><p>- The Hunting Party (level 2), by Brandes Stoddard: In the wilds, the PCs encounter a large group of goblins. The normally aggressive creatures recognize that the PCs carry their weapons with experience and skill, and they are reluctant to engage a foe who could cost them many of their own hunters and foragers. They even go so far as to buy off the PCs with a side of boar meat or venison from a recent kill.</p><p>Rules Set: 4E</p><p>Developer: Harley Stroh</p><p>Writers: Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, Harley Stroh</p><p>Cover Artist: David Griffith</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, and Harley Stroh"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "dungeoncrawlclassics_issue10_thesunlessgarden": {"human_name": "Dungeon Crawl Classics #10: The Sunless Garden", "machine_name": "dungeoncrawlclassics_issue10_thesunlessgarden", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Goodman Games", "publisher-url": "https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-10-the-sunless-garden/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>An Adventure for Character Levels 6-8!</p><p>Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was the dragon on the 20th level?

On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.</p><p>Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard - and the heretical Theophages - are lost to antiquity.</p><p>But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.</p><p>Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand. Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or - like so many others before - will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?</p><p>The boxed set is bursting with the puzzles, foes, and magic only found in a DCC RPG adventure. Inside you will find the God Eaters' grand alchymical experiment, with its spinning alembic and rotating elemental spheres. This takes the form of a large game board, approximately 17\"\" x 22\"\", with four separate spinning maps that attach to the board. An adventure booklet of 112 pages provides hitherto unknown monsters, perils, and traps. These lurk in the forgotten corridors, certain to bring a quick end to overconfident explorers.</p><p>Players will have the opportunity to study and manipulate the fabled Alembic Key, a relic rife with Theophagic sigils and zodiac signs. But beware, foolhardy reavers! Rotating the key spins the dungeon, transforming the PCs and altering reality itself! Left in the hands of a fidgety player, it could easily spell the end of the multiverse. This physical prop is composed of two spinning dials and is used by players during the adventure.</p><p>And as befitting DCC #100, the adventure is replete with player handouts in the form of a 28-page booklet containing over 40 illustrations of the Alembic, its elemental spheres, and the terrors lurking within the dark halls, as well as the infamous Sheaves of Chaos.</p><p>Finally, any adventure is only as good as the judge running it. Music of the Spheres is Chaos was designed with the judge in mind. The boxed set includes the Bookmark of 4 Parts - a tool for referencing the PCs' own changes.</p><p>This Boxed Set includes:</p><p>- Adventure Booklet (112 pages)</p><p>- Player Handout Booklet (28 pages and more than 40 illustrations)</p><p>- Large 17\" x 22\" Gameboard and four separate Spinning Maps</p><p>- Double-sided bookmark of 4 Parts (to track changes imposed by the Spinning Map)</p><p>- Alembic Key prop (used by players to spin the dungeon!)</p><p>- 3 Sheaves of Chaos handouts</p><p>With its many unique components, Music of the Spheres is Chaos captures all the magic and wonder that you've come to expect from a DCC RPG adventure. But fans familiar with Harley Stroh's work in Legacy of the Savage Kings, Sailors on the Starless Sea, and his many other adventures will know that our adventures are always far more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>You won't mistake this dungeon for any other adventure, anywhere, ever.</p><p>Be sure to check out our complete coverage of DCC #100 The Music of the Spheres is Chaos on www.goodman-games.com!
