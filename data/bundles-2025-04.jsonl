And for the dessert, we\u2019ve added things like <strong> naming characters and automatons </strong> and finally a <strong> photo mode </strong> . All of this is <strong> available for free </strong> for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid <strong> Season Pass </strong> .

Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we\u2019ll provide the technical support. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>SEASON PASS </strong> <br>The Official <strong> Season Pass </strong> for <i>Frostpunk</i> is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions ( <strong> The Last Autumn </strong> , <strong> On The Edge </strong> and <strong> The Rifts </strong> ), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game\u2019s universe. What\u2019s more, when you\u2019re done with the game itself, you\u2019ll be able to unwind while listening to the <strong> Digital Soundtrack </strong> featuring orchestrated music or learn more about the world with the exclusive <strong> Digital Artbook </strong> . <br><br>Not having the game at all? Worry no more, as the <strong> <i>Frostpunk</i>: Game of the Year Edition </strong> is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>ABOUT THE GAME</strong><strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>THE CITY MUST SURVIVE </strong> <br><br><i>Frostpunk</i>, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. <br><br>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler\u2019s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. <br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>MAKE THE LAW </strong> <br>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY </strong> <br>If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there\u2019s no turning back.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES </strong> <br>Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES </strong> <br>Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND </strong> <br>While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.<strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>PLAY ENDLESSLY </strong> <br><i>Frostpunk</i> Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that\u2019s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. The player can then decide to place one of his followers, so called Meeples, on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer.

Featuring the most popular and distinctive species ; including garden birds, exotic birds, birds of prey, water birds, flightless birds and more ; each pattern wings its way to you with step-by-step instructions and full-size templates, making them perfect for all abilities. The finished little birdies would make cute brooches, bag charms and home accessories, or can even be scaled up to make bigger plushes, all of which will make your friends into avid twitchers! Author Alison J Reid has spent months brooding away in her studio, researching all different kinds of birds, both common and rare. She has checked out their shapes, plumage and markings, and spent so much time trying to perfect their colourful, beautiful wings. It became an obsession! It was only by researching the various details that make each breed so distinctive, that Alison has been able to capture each of their unique qualities and differences. Pattern, colour and shape are key, so capturing these details in felt was important. Luckily, there are so many different colours of felt available! Felt's non-fraying, double sided, robust qualities make it easy to create all the little details that make each bird design so unique and instantly recognisable. Each bird pattern can be traced straight from the page (or enlarged if you want to sew a larger plush), and simple instructions mean that even beginners can get started. And because all the birds are sewn by hand, you don't need a sewing machine and can sit out in the garden with the birds while you sew. Whether you choose to sew just your own favourites, or make gifts for the other bird-lovers in your life, this book will provide hours of fun and inspiration.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Reid, Alison J"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "storybooktoys": {"human_name": "Storybook Toys", "machine_name": "storybooktoys", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "C&T Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Make a cherished companion for your little one Inspired by vintage patterns from the 1940s, these 16 projects include loveable dolls and softies, pillows, puppets, and even a little girl's first handbag.

Knowing what size to make is made easy thanks to a clever measuring chart at the front of the book. Simply open the flap, put your foot on the measuring gauge and instantly see what size you need. In the book are useful tables that show how much yarn and what size hook you will need for each size. Complete step-by-step instructions and charts then show you how to master each slipper type, with templates for adding non-slip soles to your crochet slippers too. Once you've mastered the slipper-making, the fun begins in creating your crochet animal designs. Choose from: the Snuggly Pug, the Cuddly Bear, the Happy Penguin, the Zingy Dinosaur, the Starry Unicorn, the Rock 'n' Roll Panda, the Sleepy Koala, the Mossy Sloth. the Graceful Elephant, the Playful Pig, the Mischievous Raccoon, the Cheeky Monkey, the Woolly Sheep, the Sandy Turtle, the Sassy Cat, the Hippie Llama, the Brave Moose, the Artful Fox, the Friendly Cow and the Roaring Lion.

Cats? But they're all the same, aren't they? Well, no not really! When you start to explore the many different breeds of cats, you realise just what a variety of breeds there is, and how different they are from each other. Author Alison J Reid has spent months beavering away in her studio, researching all different kinds of cats, both domestic and wild. She has checked out their colourings and markings, and spent so much time trying to perfect their colourful, beautiful eyes. It became an obsession! It was only by researching the various details that make each breed so distinctive, that Alison has been able to capture each of their unique qualities and differences. Pattern, colour and shape are key, so capturing these details in felt was important. Luckily, there are so many different colours of felt available, including fur-like mottled effects. Felt's non-fraying, double sided, robust qualities make it easy to create all the little details that make each cat breed so unique and instantly recognisable. She has also used small amounts of wool curls and roving to add texture for truly strokable results. Each cat pattern can be traced straight from the page (or enlarged if you want to sew a larger plush), and simple instructions mean that even beginners can get started. And because all the cats are sewn by hand, you don't need a sewing machine and can sit on the sofa with your cat while you sew. Whether you choose to sew just your own favourites, or make cats for the other crazy cat people in your life, this book will provide hours of fun and inspiration.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Reid, Alison J"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "cuddlebuddiesanimalsoftiepattern": {"human_name": "Cuddle Buddies Animal Softie Pattern", "machine_name": "cuddlebuddiesanimalsoftiepattern", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "C&T Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>5 squeezable BFFs to warm your heart Snuggable, huggable, and tons of fun to sew!

The key here is in the versatility of the EQ section, sporting four independent bands (high / low shelving, plus two midrange peaking filters) rounded out by high and low pass filters this module is particulary useful when a more precise intervention on a track is needed, still maintaining tone and organic, analog warmth in the signal path. Midrange bands can be switched to high Q for even more selective interventions while the two outer shelving bands can be switched to peaking mode, in case more articulate tone shaping on the frequency spectrum is necessary.</p><p>As in the EQ 73 special attention to detail was paid to the matching of the EQ curves which make this EQ so natural and musical sounding. However, we went a step further: the nature and beauty of these designs resides in the interaction of the preamp circuit with the EQ section so we made sure the behavior of the model was as faithful as possible to the original in this regard, a feature that no other emulation of this classic has taken into account and that makes the EQ 81 (and EQ 73 as well) a step ahead of the pack. There is virtually no audio source this EQ isn't capable of enhancing \u2014 midrange critical sources like vocals, acoustic or electric guitars, will benefit from the extended EQ capabilities, where the key frequencies are precisely tailored to always deliver musical results.</p><p>Obviously given its complete feature set the EQ 81 is at home on any source track like drums, bass, piano and strings.

It's a versatile sonic ninja of a mixing and mastering tool that features an advanced inter-sample peak limiting algorithm that lets you turn up the loudness of your mixes while still maintaining a clean a sound that\u2019s full of dynamic range and sonic breathing room.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter is your new go-to mastering peak limiter when you want impressive loudness without the damaging side effects of traditional processors. The past few decades have seen volume levels rise at an alarming rate. Loudness of mixed and mastered audio material has become a de-facto standard for contemporary music production. This quest for loudness has come at a significant cost \u2014 as producers and engineers strive to remain competitive they employ methods of extreme compression and limiting that, though they make a mix louder, also impart an unmistakable mark of residual distortion, sonic flatness and loss of overall emotion.</p><p>When used heavily, these processors flatten out the music\u2019s dynamics and get rid of much of the music\u2019s magic and emotion when passing between various sections of a song. Our goal was to provide a new kind of processor for the final peak limiting stage of the mastering process that\u2019s able to impart loudness while maintaining more perceived dynamic range than other limiters and compressors. At a basic level, T-RackS Stealth Limiter provides an impressive increase in loudness without the discernable effects of compression. Simply put, it\u2019s the most transparent, clear and loud software mastering peak limiter available. And this is all thanks to its smart level-tracking algorithm.</p><p>It works under the hood to reduce levels below the volume ceiling moment-by-moment instead of applying traditional look-ahead envelope-based fast attack compression. This algorithm doesn\u2019t sound like a compressor, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not a compressor! T-RackS Stealth Limiter\u2019s algorithm tracks the level and keeps it under control while simultaneously preserving the perceived sense of dynamics. With traditional mastering processes, it\u2019s normal to push the volume level towards a -0.1dB or even 0.0dB ceiling. Spikes above this ceiling are suppressed via the use of hard limiters and clippers. Yet these methods only ensure a stable digital level, they do not guarantee undistorted playback once the music is translated into an analog signal. This is because the process of playback involves a number of conversion processes that, though the digital waveform may be below 0.0dB, can cause the analog waveform to exceed this threshold and introduce unwanted distortion and fuzz.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter features an inter-sample peak-limiting algorithm that gets around this issue by predicting the converted analog waveform of the digital source. Through this process it\u2019s able to limit the sound in a way that ensures the final converted audio will very rarely exceed the set ceiling. This is useful in the modern era where music is often heard on different devices and via different services that all deliver their music via compressed formats, like MP3 or AAC. In all cases, it should become apparent that T-RackS Stealth Limiter easily outperforms the competition. In fact, you could say that the T-RackS Stealth Limiter really doesn\u2019t have any competition \u2014 you\u2019ll notice the dynamics of the tracks are less flattened and more respected.</p><p>This is clearly noticable with the Pop Song, where strong emotional contrasts occur when passing between verse and chorus passages.

The multiband capability is a feature that puts the De-Esser ahead of the competition making it precise and versatile on top of good sounding.

Switching to 3 bands mode allows more precision and control, particularly useful in situations like vocal tracks where sibilance is in a narrow range, and where there is the need to leave the higher part \u201cair\u201d untouched. The dedicated control set also allows you to precisely tailor the operating mode, and audition the de-essing action or the part of the audio spectrum the processor is working on. he primary use of this processor is obviously on vocal tracks: this is where the IK Multimedia De-esser shines thanks to its multiband capability which allows to zone in with extreme precision on the troublesome frequency and put it under control.</p><p>However, there are several other instances where a de-esser can be a secret weapon where an EQ would be too a drastic solution: hi-hat or crash cymbals can sometimes sound harsh or overly bright in a mix; using an EQ would fix this, but would probably affect also the rest of the high end content of the mix. That's where frequency conscious compression comes to the rescue: setting the De-Esser on the right frequency and threshold will allow to reduce the harshness of too bright cymbals only when they are hit, and with the precise setting of release time the action would be unobtrusive and transparent to the rest of the mix.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trdeesser/?srsltid=AfmBOopWsk7sWdF_TY9MX24uWa2BhVMhpSyr_1rG45StUBV28lqNS2ue"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "modobass_britcustomkit": {"human_name": "MODO DRUM - Brit Custom Kit", "machine_name": "modobass_britcustomkit", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $49.99</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>The Brit Custom is a 4-piece birch kit with a warm and rich sound that makes it perfect for music styles like indie-pop and indie-rock.

A Garden's Purpose is an important, timely book.\"\" - Georgina Reid, editor of Wonderground Journal and author of The Planthunter: Truth, Beauty, Chaos, and Plants</p><p>The garden provides a powerful, generous way of looking at the world. Through stories and essays, this gracious volume, written in a highly accessible tone, invites readers on a journey to understand gardens as places where we build mutually beneficial relationships with the living world around us.</p><p>As beautiful spaces, gardens fill us with hope and wonder. As gathering places, they nurture friendships and communities. Thoughtfully crafted, they make us pause and appreciate our surroundings. Full of edible plants, they nourish us. Full of diversity-human and non-human-they connect us with the polychromatic world in which we live. They make us feel at home in our own bodies, in our cities, and on our planet.</p><p>Each chapter in this book is dedicated to a specific idea or element of the garden, from places where gardens grow (i.e., a driveway in San Francisco, a bathtub as a planter) to garden management (why some lawns need watering every few days, and some gardens can go almost a full year without irrigation) to color and texture (i.e., how fine-textured plants like grasses can be used to unify a space), and everything in between. Hundreds of gardens from all corners of the globe are included,photographed in glorious full color.</p><p>Perfect for home gardeners, landscape designers, or as a gift for the gardener in your life, this is an ode to the wonder, design, and habitat of gardens, and an inspiration to nurture meaningful relationships with the natural world around us.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Felix de Rosen", "developer-url": "https://polycultura.com/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"bookindustrycharitablefoundation": {"machine_name": "bookindustrycharitablefoundation", "youtube_link": null, "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><em>Donations to support Book Industry Charitable Foundation are made to &nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPal Giving Fund</a>, subject to its policies.</em><em><br></em></p>\n<p>For more than twenty years, the Book Industry Charitable (Binc) Foundation has helped bookstore and comic book store employees and owners who encounter unexpected financial crises.

Kitted out with 3000 horsepower and Head End Power, the F59PH was among the top brass of locomotives, making them a clear candidate to work in tandem with modern cars and capable of handling busy schedules. <br><br>First settling into service in Toronto, Canada, the early 1990s saw a fleet of locos ordered for Metrolink to embark out of Los Angeles and run across their sprawling Californian network. As years have rolled by, so too has technology, but despite two newer diesel types in traffic today, the F59PH hangs on as the F59PHR \u2013 a rebuilt variant which can meet modern emission standards. <br><br>As part of their age, the Metrolink F59PHRs still hang onto their classic white undercoat, a stark contrast to the silver sheen of their passenger equipment.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Reducing the lawn is among the biggest trends in homeownership, with an endless stream of\u00a0homeowners looking for an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional turfgrass lawn.

Groundcover Revolution is here with all the answers you need (and some you didn't even know you needed!).  Those answers include: \u2022 How replacing a lawn with groundcovers reduces resource consumption on a significant level \u2022 Why groundcovers require far less long-term maintenance than turf after establishment \u2022 The many additional benefits of groundcovers, including erosion control, a reduction in chemical usage, a\u00a0boost in biodiversity, and mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink \u2022 The ways groundcovers overcome challenges such as tree roots, compacted soils, poor drainage, and dense shade \u2022 The step-by-step mechanics of how to get rid of your lawn, how to place and plant groundcovers from seeds, plugs, or transplants, and how to care for your new \"quilted lawn\" once it's in place\u00a0  Also included are 40 in-depth profiles of plants that are perfect choices for replacing a grass lawn.

Growing an Edible Landscape is here to help answer all of these questions and many more.Setting up an edible landscape is much more than just placing a few tomato-filled raised beds in the middle of the lawn, though for some gardeners, this might be a logical place to start. The eventual goal, however, is to have a landscape filled with layers of fruitful plants combined together to produce edible harvests for as many months of the year as possible. To reach that end, there's much to plan and do to ensure your success.

All the greats started as interns and you\u2019ve only got seventeen cycles to prove that you belong in the newsroom.<br>We\u2019re assigning you stories that put the <i> hyper </i> in hyper-local news! On any given cycle choose to cover shuttle crashes, intersolar cat shows, even space ghost funerals. It\u2019s up to you! <br><br>Once you\u2019ve chosen your assignment, head to the shuttle bay and blast off for intern adventures!! That means interviewing sources, digging up clues and investigating the scene. We hope your conversational circuits are well oiled as you earn or betray the trust of more than 100 characters and ask a lot of questions. <br><br>There\u2019s always more than meets the eye, and the more information you can gather, the more equipped you'll be.<br>At the end of each assignment, it\u2019s time to file your story. <br><br>Use the Build-a-Story\u2122 tool to construct your article using all that info you gathered. Depending on who you interviewed, the choices you made and how deep you dug, you\u2019ll have different options to work with for your story\u2014you were a diligent reporterbot and managed to get ALL the info, weren\u2019t you?<br><br>Your choices impact the quality and tone of the story and how both your editors and readers will react to it. Over time, the choices in each story start to shape the reputation and popularity of a holopaper. So hey, no pressure! <br><br>Designed and written by former journalists, this is almost <i> exactly </i> how real journalism is done. Except with aliens.<br>The staff at Times & Galaxy all live and work together on the Scanner, a sprawling, spacebound newsroom. <br><br>Between assignments, you\u2019ll have the chance to get to explore the Scanner and get to know a diverse and colorful crew of more than twenty crewmates including your fellow reporters, the editorial staff, pilots and ship\u2019s crew. <br><br>The staff come from all over the system, where you\u2019ll find Humans, Augers, Verge, Xeel and of course, Robos. <br><br>Everyone has their own thing going on and they\u2019ve always got something to say. They\u2019ll react to you in all sorts of expected, and unexpected, ways depending on your choices. <br><br>The Scanner is more than just a newsroom. It\u2019s where you sleep, eat, work and relax. <br><br>After recharging your literal batteries in your bunk you might take a moment to recharge your emotional ones in the Garden, home to many species of plants from all over the system. Or at least it used to be. Find seeds to restore the green space to its former glory! <br><br><br>As well as selecting your chassis and paint job before you arrive at the Scanner, you\u2019ll be able to requisition upgrades from the ship\u2019s Shuttlebots. Just watch out for the mouth on some of them. \u201cBeep\u201d has never sounded so aggressive.<br>Writers at Copychaser spent years working as journalists before entering the games industry and have a deep love of local journalism and the connections it creates in communities around the world. <br><br>While working on the writing teams of games like Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, they saw how players loved the relationships between characters as much as, or even more than the combat and adventure. <br><br>And so Times & Galaxy was born. We\u2019re excited to bring you this truly unique adventure game where you can step into the metal boots of the first-ever robo reporter.
