As years have rolled by, so too has technology, but despite two newer diesel types in traffic today, the F59PH hangs on as the F59PHR \u2013 a rebuilt variant which can meet modern emission standards. <br><br>As part of their age, the Metrolink F59PHRs still hang onto their classic white undercoat, a stark contrast to the silver sheen of their passenger equipment. The F59PHR comes accompanied with the bombardier bi-level cars in their grey liveries. <br><br>Multiply your Metrolink experience on the Antelope Valley or San Bernardino Lines with the F59PHR in Train Sim World 5! Take to the rails of any US route in your collection with Free Roam. <br><br><strong> Please Note: For the full experience, we recommend you own Train Sim World 5: Antelope Valley Line which is available as a separate purchase. </strong> <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Key Features </strong> <br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>F59PHR locomotive in Metrolink white livery</li>\n<li>Bi-level cars in Metrolink grey liveries</li>\n<li>Climb into the highly detailed, feature-rich, cab of this classic locomotive</li>\n<li>Feel the powerful, true-to-life performance and suspension</li>\n<li>Learn to drive the F59PHR with accessible Tutorials on the Training Center</li>\n<li>Operate passenger trains across Scenarios and in the Timetable of Antelope Valley Line</li>\n<li>Also appears in the San Bernardino Line Timetable</li>\n<li>Livery Designer, Formation Designer and Scenario Planner compatible.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Reducing the lawn is among the biggest trends in homeownership, with an endless stream of\u00a0homeowners looking for an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional turfgrass lawn. In the last few years alone, over 23 million American adults converted part of their lawn to a natural landscape, and now they're looking to do even more.  The biggest challenge to adopting this new ideal of the perfect lawn? Knowing how and when to replace your turf, and which plants are the best ones for the job. Groundcover Revolution is here with all the answers you need (and some you didn't even know you needed!).  Those answers include: \u2022 How replacing a lawn with groundcovers reduces resource consumption on a significant level \u2022 Why groundcovers require far less long-term maintenance than turf after establishment \u2022 The many additional benefits of groundcovers, including erosion control, a reduction in chemical usage, a\u00a0boost in biodiversity, and mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink \u2022 The ways groundcovers overcome challenges such as tree roots, compacted soils, poor drainage, and dense shade \u2022 The step-by-step mechanics of how to get rid of your lawn, how to place and plant groundcovers from seeds, plugs, or transplants, and how to care for your new \"quilted lawn\" once it's in place\u00a0  Also included are 40 in-depth profiles of plants that are perfect choices for replacing a grass lawn. There are options for sun, for shade, for dry and wet sites, and for various climates around the globe.

Author Kathy Jentz has also included an incredibly useful chart that gives youall the specifics on each of the 40 choices for quick reference and to make your groundcover selection process even easier.  Don't let a lack of information stop you from creating the no-mow groundcover lawn of your dreams.

To reach that end, there's much to plan and do to ensure your success.

On any given cycle choose to cover shuttle crashes, intersolar cat shows, even space ghost funerals. It\u2019s up to you! <br><br>Once you\u2019ve chosen your assignment, head to the shuttle bay and blast off for intern adventures!! That means interviewing sources, digging up clues and investigating the scene. We hope your conversational circuits are well oiled as you earn or betray the trust of more than 100 characters and ask a lot of questions. <br><br>There\u2019s always more than meets the eye, and the more information you can gather, the more equipped you'll be.<br>At the end of each assignment, it\u2019s time to file your story. <br><br>Use the Build-a-Story\u2122 tool to construct your article using all that info you gathered. Depending on who you interviewed, the choices you made and how deep you dug, you\u2019ll have different options to work with for your story\u2014you were a diligent reporterbot and managed to get ALL the info, weren\u2019t you?<br><br>Your choices impact the quality and tone of the story and how both your editors and readers will react to it. Over time, the choices in each story start to shape the reputation and popularity of a holopaper. So hey, no pressure! <br><br>Designed and written by former journalists, this is almost <i> exactly </i> how real journalism is done. Except with aliens.<br>The staff at Times & Galaxy all live and work together on the Scanner, a sprawling, spacebound newsroom. <br><br>Between assignments, you\u2019ll have the chance to get to explore the Scanner and get to know a diverse and colorful crew of more than twenty crewmates including your fellow reporters, the editorial staff, pilots and ship\u2019s crew. <br><br>The staff come from all over the system, where you\u2019ll find Humans, Augers, Verge, Xeel and of course, Robos. <br><br>Everyone has their own thing going on and they\u2019ve always got something to say. They\u2019ll react to you in all sorts of expected, and unexpected, ways depending on your choices. <br><br>The Scanner is more than just a newsroom. It\u2019s where you sleep, eat, work and relax. <br><br>After recharging your literal batteries in your bunk you might take a moment to recharge your emotional ones in the Garden, home to many species of plants from all over the system. Or at least it used to be. Find seeds to restore the green space to its former glory! <br><br><br>As well as selecting your chassis and paint job before you arrive at the Scanner, you\u2019ll be able to requisition upgrades from the ship\u2019s Shuttlebots. Just watch out for the mouth on some of them. \u201cBeep\u201d has never sounded so aggressive.<br>Writers at Copychaser spent years working as journalists before entering the games industry and have a deep love of local journalism and the connections it creates in communities around the world. <br><br>While working on the writing teams of games like Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, they saw how players loved the relationships between characters as much as, or even more than the combat and adventure. <br><br>And so Times & Galaxy was born. We\u2019re excited to bring you this truly unique adventure game where you can step into the metal boots of the first-ever robo reporter.
