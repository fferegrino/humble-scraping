However, we went a step further: the nature and beauty of these designs resides in the interaction of the preamp circuit with the EQ section so we made sure the behavior of the model was as faithful as possible to the original in this regard, a feature that no other emulation of this classic has taken into account and that makes the EQ 81 (and EQ 73 as well) a step ahead of the pack. There is virtually no audio source this EQ isn't capable of enhancing \u2014 midrange critical sources like vocals, acoustic or electric guitars, will benefit from the extended EQ capabilities, where the key frequencies are precisely tailored to always deliver musical results.</p><p>Obviously given its complete feature set the EQ 81 is at home on any source track like drums, bass, piano and strings.

It's a versatile sonic ninja of a mixing and mastering tool that features an advanced inter-sample peak limiting algorithm that lets you turn up the loudness of your mixes while still maintaining a clean a sound that\u2019s full of dynamic range and sonic breathing room.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter is your new go-to mastering peak limiter when you want impressive loudness without the damaging side effects of traditional processors. The past few decades have seen volume levels rise at an alarming rate. Loudness of mixed and mastered audio material has become a de-facto standard for contemporary music production. This quest for loudness has come at a significant cost \u2014 as producers and engineers strive to remain competitive they employ methods of extreme compression and limiting that, though they make a mix louder, also impart an unmistakable mark of residual distortion, sonic flatness and loss of overall emotion.</p><p>When used heavily, these processors flatten out the music\u2019s dynamics and get rid of much of the music\u2019s magic and emotion when passing between various sections of a song. Our goal was to provide a new kind of processor for the final peak limiting stage of the mastering process that\u2019s able to impart loudness while maintaining more perceived dynamic range than other limiters and compressors. At a basic level, T-RackS Stealth Limiter provides an impressive increase in loudness without the discernable effects of compression. Simply put, it\u2019s the most transparent, clear and loud software mastering peak limiter available. And this is all thanks to its smart level-tracking algorithm.</p><p>It works under the hood to reduce levels below the volume ceiling moment-by-moment instead of applying traditional look-ahead envelope-based fast attack compression. This algorithm doesn\u2019t sound like a compressor, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not a compressor! T-RackS Stealth Limiter\u2019s algorithm tracks the level and keeps it under control while simultaneously preserving the perceived sense of dynamics. With traditional mastering processes, it\u2019s normal to push the volume level towards a -0.1dB or even 0.0dB ceiling. Spikes above this ceiling are suppressed via the use of hard limiters and clippers. Yet these methods only ensure a stable digital level, they do not guarantee undistorted playback once the music is translated into an analog signal. This is because the process of playback involves a number of conversion processes that, though the digital waveform may be below 0.0dB, can cause the analog waveform to exceed this threshold and introduce unwanted distortion and fuzz.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter features an inter-sample peak-limiting algorithm that gets around this issue by predicting the converted analog waveform of the digital source. Through this process it\u2019s able to limit the sound in a way that ensures the final converted audio will very rarely exceed the set ceiling. This is useful in the modern era where music is often heard on different devices and via different services that all deliver their music via compressed formats, like MP3 or AAC. In all cases, it should become apparent that T-RackS Stealth Limiter easily outperforms the competition. In fact, you could say that the T-RackS Stealth Limiter really doesn\u2019t have any competition \u2014 you\u2019ll notice the dynamics of the tracks are less flattened and more respected.</p><p>This is clearly noticable with the Pop Song, where strong emotional contrasts occur when passing between verse and chorus passages. On the Crossover Rock track, T-RackS Stealth Limiter maintains the attack of the drums \u2014 a nuance that's lost by other limiters to varying degrees. And, on the EDM track, T-RackS Stealth Limiter's invisible touch means that the punch and perceived impact is much higher. No matter the situation, T-RackS Stealth Limiter simply sounds cleaner, more open and more detailed than any other limiter currently on the market.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trstealthlimiter/?srsltid=AfmBOor6zqRjxj9C-84Q1BsyRyV4co7sXnUKNjPNAqPlX-Zux8fL8VRF"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "totalstudioessentials": {"human_name": "Total Studio Essentials", "machine_name": "totalstudioessentials", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $500</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>This content&nbsp;<span>includes</span> T-RackS 6, AmpliTube 5 SE, TONEX SE, and SampleTank 4 SE ($500 value)<br><br>T-RackS 6 is a complete mixing and mastering ecosystem with single effects, an al-in-one plug-in and a standalone mastering console.

Under Santa Fe-ownership, the fleet became famous for both passenger and freight operations, including the Super Chief, which it led across the states sporting the bold Red, Yellow and Silver accents of the Warbonnet livery.</p>\n<p>Having long fallen out of favour for more modern motive power, as at a mere 1500 horsepower a piece, they\u2019re certainly no match for the likes of the ES44C4, the F7 still manages to look state-of-the-art to this day and makes for a nostalgic sight for any railfan.</p>\n<p>In Train Sim World 3, the Santa Fe F7 brings celebratory heritage action to Cajon Pass; from switching to summit conquering, haul manifest freight in warbonnet style and bring a taste of yesteryear to the railfans of California!</p>\n<p><strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Key Features </strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>F7A and F7B diesel locomotive in Santa Fe Warbonnet livery</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boxcar in Yellow livery</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Highly detailed, feature-rich, driving cab</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>True-to-life performance and handling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Includes Training Module on the Training Center</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Includes 3 Scenarios and 18 additional Timetable Services for Cajon Pass</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Livery Designer, Scenario Planner and Creators Club compatible</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Powered by Dovetail Games\u2019 proprietary SimuGraph\u00ae vehicle dynamics engine and Unreal Engine 4\u00ae technology</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download size: 764.92mb</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Dovetail Games", "developer-url": "https://dovetailgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "trainsimworld5_thameslinkbrclass700_0emuadd-on": {"human_name": "Train Sim World 5: Thameslink BR Class 700/0 EMU Add-On", "machine_name": "trainsimworld5_thameslinkbrclass700_0emuadd-on", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<p>Loco add-on: Tour the Southeast of the UK in the regal fashion</p>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 15.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><strong>TSW Compatible content released for a previous Train Sim World\u00ae - features may remain unchanged from the original release and may not make use of all newer core features. </strong> <br><br>Modern commuting doesn\u2019t get any better than this, experience the state-of-the-art Desiro City and crunch capacity through the Medway Towns with the Thameslink BR Class 700/0, ready for Kentish service in Train Sim World\u00ae! <br><br>The Thameslink Programme, a phrase which is ingrained into the minds of every Southeast commuter, was the radical transformation of travel through the centre of London.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Then it's time to say goodbye to your standard grass lawn and join the Groundcover Revolution!\u00a0 Turns out you're not alone in your desire to ditch the lawn and replace it with something prettier, more diverse, lower maintenance, welcoming to pollinators, and good for Earth's climate health. Reducing the lawn is among the biggest trends in homeownership, with an endless stream of\u00a0homeowners looking for an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional turfgrass lawn. In the last few years alone, over 23 million American adults converted part of their lawn to a natural landscape, and now they're looking to do even more.  The biggest challenge to adopting this new ideal of the perfect lawn? Knowing how and when to replace your turf, and which plants are the best ones for the job. Groundcover Revolution is here with all the answers you need (and some you didn't even know you needed!).  Those answers include: \u2022 How replacing a lawn with groundcovers reduces resource consumption on a significant level \u2022 Why groundcovers require far less long-term maintenance than turf after establishment \u2022 The many additional benefits of groundcovers, including erosion control, a reduction in chemical usage, a\u00a0boost in biodiversity, and mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink \u2022 The ways groundcovers overcome challenges such as tree roots, compacted soils, poor drainage, and dense shade \u2022 The step-by-step mechanics of how to get rid of your lawn, how to place and plant groundcovers from seeds, plugs, or transplants, and how to care for your new \"quilted lawn\" once it's in place\u00a0  Also included are 40 in-depth profiles of plants that are perfect choices for replacing a grass lawn. There are options for sun, for shade, for dry and wet sites, and for various climates around the globe. There are choices that bloom, options that are evergreen, and selections that are deer resistant. Author Kathy Jentz has also included an incredibly useful chart that gives youall the specifics on each of the 40 choices for quick reference and to make your groundcover selection process even easier.  Don't let a lack of information stop you from creating the no-mow groundcover lawn of your dreams. Join the revolution and say goodbye to the burden of lawn care and hello to summer weekends relaxing by the pool or camping with family and friends.\u00a0Whether you want to replace the entire lawn or just reduce the amount of land dedicated to turf, it's time to usher in a new and improved idea of what a beautiful lawn should be.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Kathy Jentz"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "growinganediblelandscape_howtotransformyouroutdoorspaceintoafoodga": {"human_name": "Growing an Edible Landscape: How to Transform Your Outdoor Space into a Food Garden", "machine_name": "growinganediblelandscape_howtotransformyouroutdoorspaceintoafoodga", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Cool Springs Press", "publisher-url": "https://www.quarto.com/books/9780760381489/growing-an-edible-landscape"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 10.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Convert your unproductive lawn and landscape areas into fruitful edible gardens with this practical guide overflowing with ideas, plans, designs, and know-how.Out with the lawn and in with the food! That's the battle cry of millions of modern gardeners who are not only looking to reduce the amount of time and energy they have to spend tending a lawn, but they're also looking to improve the lives of their family, friends, and neighbors by supplying them with fresh, homegrown food. In the United States alone, 46 million acres of land are covered in turfgrass (that's more acreage than corn and soybeans combined!). Imagine all the good that would come if that land were dedicated to growing food instead!\u00a0Converting unused areas of the landscape into food gardens\u00a0helps mitigate the effects of climate change, reduces food miles, improves food security, and allows us to be a better steward of our little slice of the planet. But how do you get started? Which plants do you choose? Is there a series of best practices to follow to successfully convert your yard into an edible oasis so that it's not just high-yielding, but it's also attractive? Growing an Edible Landscape is here to help answer all of these questions and many more.Setting up an edible landscape is much more than just placing a few tomato-filled raised beds in the middle of the lawn, though for some gardeners, this might be a logical place to start. The eventual goal, however, is to have a landscape filled with layers of fruitful plants combined together to produce edible harvests for as many months of the year as possible. To reach that end, there's much to plan and do to ensure your success. Authors Gary Pilarchik of @therustedgarden and Dr. Chiara D'Amore have devised the perfect guidebook to take you from \"turfgrass overwhelm\" to consistent harvests of a huge diversity of homegrown edible plants. And the best part is\u2014you can create an edible paradise whether your yard is large or small, sunny or shaded, urban or rural, or level or sloped.\u00a0 A few highlights of the systems and techniques outlined in these pages include:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 The phases of the transformation process and how they are different for everyone \u2022 Real-world, sensible garden design options\u00a0for edible yards\u00a0 \u2022Step-by-step projects to get growing today \u2022 How to choose the edible plants that are best for your conditions\u00a0 \u2022Practical plant-care tips for everything from seed starting to fertilizing and\u00a0watering \u2022 Pick-and-choose menus to help you combine productive plants in an attractive way\u00a0 \u2022 Ways in which\u00a0your edible landscape can cultivate community\u00a0  Also included are 25 profiles of common and uncommon plants for an edible yard. From raspberries and asparagus to fruit trees and dandelions, these food plants are great additions to any edible landscape plan. Start small or go big\u2014it's your choice!
