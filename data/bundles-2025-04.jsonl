These gardens are imbued with romance and emotion, yet they have so much more to offer than their gorgeous aesthetics.\u00a0Naturalistic garden designs, such as those featured in this groundbreaking new book, contribute to positive environmental change by increasing biodiversity, providing a refuge for wildlife, and reconnecting humans to nature.\u00a0In the pages of\u00a0New Naturalism\u00a0you'll find:\u00a0\u2022Planting recipes for building meadows, prairies, and other grassland-inspired open plantings even in compact, urban settings\u2022Nature-inspired ways to upgrade existing foundation plantings, shrub beds, and flower borders to a wilder aesthetic while still managing the space\u2022Inspiration for taking sidewalk and driveway plantings and turning them into visually soft, welcoming spaces for humans and wildlife alike\u2022Ideas for turning shady landscapes into canopied retreats that celebrate nature\u00a0\u2022Creative ways to make an ecologically vibrant garden in even the smallest of spacesNew Naturalism\u00a0approaches the planting beds around our homes as ecological systems.

Reducing the lawn is among the biggest trends in homeownership, with an endless stream of\u00a0homeowners looking for an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional turfgrass lawn. In the last few years alone, over 23 million American adults converted part of their lawn to a natural landscape, and now they're looking to do even more.  The biggest challenge to adopting this new ideal of the perfect lawn? Knowing how and when to replace your turf, and which plants are the best ones for the job. Groundcover Revolution is here with all the answers you need (and some you didn't even know you needed!).  Those answers include: \u2022 How replacing a lawn with groundcovers reduces resource consumption on a significant level \u2022 Why groundcovers require far less long-term maintenance than turf after establishment \u2022 The many additional benefits of groundcovers, including erosion control, a reduction in chemical usage, a\u00a0boost in biodiversity, and mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink \u2022 The ways groundcovers overcome challenges such as tree roots, compacted soils, poor drainage, and dense shade \u2022 The step-by-step mechanics of how to get rid of your lawn, how to place and plant groundcovers from seeds, plugs, or transplants, and how to care for your new \"quilted lawn\" once it's in place\u00a0  Also included are 40 in-depth profiles of plants that are perfect choices for replacing a grass lawn.

Is there a series of best practices to follow to successfully convert your yard into an edible oasis so that it's not just high-yielding, but it's also attractive? Growing an Edible Landscape is here to help answer all of these questions and many more.Setting up an edible landscape is much more than just placing a few tomato-filled raised beds in the middle of the lawn, though for some gardeners, this might be a logical place to start. The eventual goal, however, is to have a landscape filled with layers of fruitful plants combined together to produce edible harvests for as many months of the year as possible. To reach that end, there's much to plan and do to ensure your success.

All the greats started as interns and you\u2019ve only got seventeen cycles to prove that you belong in the newsroom.<br>We\u2019re assigning you stories that put the <i> hyper </i> in hyper-local news! On any given cycle choose to cover shuttle crashes, intersolar cat shows, even space ghost funerals. It\u2019s up to you! <br><br>Once you\u2019ve chosen your assignment, head to the shuttle bay and blast off for intern adventures!! That means interviewing sources, digging up clues and investigating the scene. We hope your conversational circuits are well oiled as you earn or betray the trust of more than 100 characters and ask a lot of questions. <br><br>There\u2019s always more than meets the eye, and the more information you can gather, the more equipped you'll be.<br>At the end of each assignment, it\u2019s time to file your story. <br><br>Use the Build-a-Story\u2122 tool to construct your article using all that info you gathered. Depending on who you interviewed, the choices you made and how deep you dug, you\u2019ll have different options to work with for your story\u2014you were a diligent reporterbot and managed to get ALL the info, weren\u2019t you?<br><br>Your choices impact the quality and tone of the story and how both your editors and readers will react to it. Over time, the choices in each story start to shape the reputation and popularity of a holopaper. So hey, no pressure! <br><br>Designed and written by former journalists, this is almost <i> exactly </i> how real journalism is done. Except with aliens.<br>The staff at Times & Galaxy all live and work together on the Scanner, a sprawling, spacebound newsroom. <br><br>Between assignments, you\u2019ll have the chance to get to explore the Scanner and get to know a diverse and colorful crew of more than twenty crewmates including your fellow reporters, the editorial staff, pilots and ship\u2019s crew. <br><br>The staff come from all over the system, where you\u2019ll find Humans, Augers, Verge, Xeel and of course, Robos. <br><br>Everyone has their own thing going on and they\u2019ve always got something to say. They\u2019ll react to you in all sorts of expected, and unexpected, ways depending on your choices. <br><br>The Scanner is more than just a newsroom. It\u2019s where you sleep, eat, work and relax. <br><br>After recharging your literal batteries in your bunk you might take a moment to recharge your emotional ones in the Garden, home to many species of plants from all over the system. Or at least it used to be. Find seeds to restore the green space to its former glory! <br><br><br>As well as selecting your chassis and paint job before you arrive at the Scanner, you\u2019ll be able to requisition upgrades from the ship\u2019s Shuttlebots. Just watch out for the mouth on some of them. \u201cBeep\u201d has never sounded so aggressive.<br>Writers at Copychaser spent years working as journalists before entering the games industry and have a deep love of local journalism and the connections it creates in communities around the world. <br><br>While working on the writing teams of games like Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, they saw how players loved the relationships between characters as much as, or even more than the combat and adventure. <br><br>And so Times & Galaxy was born. We\u2019re excited to bring you this truly unique adventure game where you can step into the metal boots of the first-ever robo reporter. Chase down leads, break system-rocking news, get quotes, make friends (or enemies), eat a dirt pie!

Drive down the currency of a foreign country to improve the margins of the companies that import their products? Why not? The only consequences that matter are the ones that impact our bottom line. <br><br>Every Joe Schmo has access to the regular news.
