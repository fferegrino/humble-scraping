Those who possessed great power and cunning are reborn as even mightier individuals, and the greatest rakshasa will someday return as Ravana.

The standard vampire that we know as the common variety is far removed from this first cause, but it still thrives on the same negative energy. Vampires have a natural sensitivity to places where negative energy pools, and this is why they are often found at the center of wars, revolutions, and corruption.</p><p>But there is more to this story. Unbeknownst to all but the most erudite sages, vampires are a necessary byproduct of the natural order of things. The process that forms a vampire spawn from a creature slain by a vampire actually sucks ambient negative energy out of the prime material plane, concentrating it in the undead life force of the newly revived spawn. Vampires act as living conduits of negative energy, channeling it into themselves through their own actions, then feeding off it and destroying it in the process.</p><p>Thus, the deities that govern good and law allow vampires to exist. Their followers are sent to defeat the vampires, but the scales can never tip too far. By their very nature, vampires act as lightning rods for negative energy; as they feed off it, they reduce its concentration in the world, and they absorb the foul byproducts of human conflict that would otherwise attract far greater evils.</p><p>A few vampires gain true insight into their natural position in the world. These arch-vampires do not accept that the gods should \u201callow\u201d vampires to exist. The most powerful arch-vampires become demi-gods and travel to the outer planes, where they direct armies of minions and sponsor other arch-vampires.</p><p>For generations, the old gods regarded the arch-vampire demi-gods as a natural correction mechanism, much like wolves who feed on overpopulated deer. But now the wolves seek to become king. The vampire armies are becoming more active, and the forces of good have stepped up their efforts against them. For the first time, the scales are tipping toward the vampires\u2019 favor.</p><p>The Complete Guide to Vampires takes you into this world of bloodlust and power in an exploration of the greatest monster of all time.

Long ago, the elves killed Grimtooth\u2019s father in a great battle. They hid the troll leader\u2019s body and his mystic warhammer somewhere in the vast plains beyond Trapsylvania. After years of searching, Grimtooth has finally located his father\u2019s tomb, but the elves have magically rigged it so that no troll can enter. Now Grimtooth is looking for a party of foolhardy adventurers to enter Grimfang\u2019s Tomb and return with the legendary warhammer\u2026</p><p>Rules Set: DCC RPG</p><p>Writers: Ken St. Andre and Steve Crompton</p><p>Cover Art: Steve Crompton</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Ken St. Andre and Steve Crompton", "developer-url": "https://goodman-games.com/store/product/grimtooths-tomb-of-the-warhammer/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "cthulhualphabet": {"human_name": "Cthulhu Alphabet", "machine_name": "cthulhualphabet", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Goodman Games", "publisher-url": "https://goodman-games.com/store/product/the-cthulhu-alphabet-pdf/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>The Cthulhu Alphabet is a prolifically illustrated tabletop RPG supplement published in PDF format.</p><p>The Cthulhu Alphabet is a collection of random tables to inspire your role-playing game, structured around an abecedarian theme.
