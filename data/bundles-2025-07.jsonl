Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive.

The Cybersecurity Trinity will provide cybersecurity professionals with the necessary background to improve their defenses by harnessing the combined power of these three concepts. The book is divided into four sections, one addressing each underlying concept and the final section discussing integrating them to harness their full potential. With the expected growth of AI and machine learning (ML), cybersecurity professionals must understand its core concepts to defend AI and ML-based systems. Also, most cybersecurity tools now incorporate AI and ML. However, many cybersecurity professionals lack a fundamental understanding of AI and ML. The book's first section aims to demystify AI and ML for cybersecurity practitioners by exploring how AI and ML systems work, where they are vulnerable, and how to defend them. Next, we turn our attention to security automation. Human-centered cyber defense processes cannot keep pace with the threats targeting organizations. Security automation can help defenders drastically increase the speed of detection and response. This section will discuss core use cases that security teams can implement, including intelligence processing, incident triage, detection, and response. This section will end with strategies for a successful security automation implementation and strategies that can lead to failure. Accelerating the defense is but one side of the equation. Defenders can also implement ACD methods to disrupt and slow the attacker. Of course, ACD spans a broad spectrum, including some that could raise legal and ethical concerns. This section will explore some ACD methods and discuss their applicability, as well as the need to include business, legal, and ethical considerations when implementing them. Security teams often treat AI, automation, and ACD as disparate solutions, addressing specific problems. However, there is much overlap, and security teams must develop a cohesive approach to realize the full potential. The last section combines these three concepts to form a comprehensive strategy. The resulting strategy will have AI as the foundation, incorporating automation to speed up defense and ACD to disrupt the attacker. \u00a0 What You Will Learn:  Understand the many uses of AI and ML and the concepts underpinning these technologies.

Organizations began to see the real value of information and information technology in the mid-1980s. Forty years later, it\u2019s time to leverage your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy in the same way. The main topics covered include the case for action with specific coverage on the topic of cybersecurity as a value creator, including how the courts, legislators, and regulators are raising the bar for C-suite executives and board members. The book covers how the board\u2019s three primary responsibilities (talent management, strategy, and risk management) intersect with their ECRM responsibilities.ECRM was once solely focused on managing the downside of risk by defending the organization from adversarial, accidental, structural, and environmental threat sources. Author BobChaput presents the view that we must focus equally on managing the upside of cyber strengths to increase customer trust and brand loyalty, improving social responsibility, driving revenue growth, lowering the cost of capital, attracting higher quality investments, creating competitive advantage, attracting and retaining talent, and facilitating M&amp;A work. He focuses on the C-suite and board role in the first part and provides guidance on their roles and responsibilities, the most important decision about ECRM they must facilitate, and how to think differently about ECRM funding. You will learn how to the pivot from cost-center thinking to value-center thinking.Having built the case for action, in the second part, the book details the steps that organizations must take to develop and document their ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy. The book first covers how ECRM must be integrated into business strategy. The remainder of that part presents a sample table of contents for an ECRM Program and Cybersecurity Strategy document and works through each section to facilitate development of your own program and strategy.

Though initially thought to come from afar, this great evil, known only as Xanathar, instead resides within Waterdeep and, if not stopped, threatens to overwhelm the city. The Lords of Waterdeep believe that the evil lurks in the sewers below and have commissioned a party of adventurers to investigate and foil this nefarious plot. Granted full rights of marque and ownership of any treasure, artifacts or valuables you find on your quest, you must venture into the chasms, discover the nature of this evil and destroy it by any means necessary.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n EYE OF THE BEHOLDER II: THE LEGEND OF DARKMOON\n</strong>\n<br>\nFollowing your quest in the sewers beneath, you and your party are recovering with Waterdeep\u2019s finest healers, when a letter arrives from Khelben Blackstaff, mystic advisor to the Lords of Waterdeep.

Although nothing has been confirmed, renowned but troublesome archaeologist, Wently Kelso believes the disturbances are related to an evil uprising and the presence of a powerful ancient artefact. These troubles could, of course, simply be the work of unruly bandits, but since Kelso\u2019s previous findings in the sewers of Waterdeep proved true, one would be wise not to easily dismiss his opinion on the matter.

It's also \"a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called <strong> 'one of this year's finest strategy games' </strong> back in 2009\" (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer) <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>The most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming returns... with a host of mutual enemies. </strong> <br><br>Face off against a more advanced version of the original AI, who once again has captured the entire galaxy leaving you only a tiny planet to yourself. Then strike out and find a way to cleverly outwit it nonetheless. All the new capturables, larger fleets, and hacking abilities are sure to help. (You're going to need it.) <br><br>Or immerse yourself in a far more complicated galactic struggle involving the nanocaust, macrophages, dyson spheres, and more. Other factions each have their own goals, rules, units, and entirely unique economies. Make the scenario complicated enough and it can become \"World War XV is in progress, you're in a tiny farm in the middle of it, nobody likes you, but if you can just kill that one giant angry enemy leader this will all be over.\" <br><br>If that sounds over the top -- and frankly that bit is wearying to us to imagine even though some people seek it out -- then take a break and maybe hack the all-consuming computer virus to be your ally, and convince the star-sized alien hives to watch your back as you take on a suddenly-less-arrogant AI. <br><br><i> (If you're really feeling spiteful, take yourself out of the equation, turn on super fast forward, and watch them all fight like ants on a galactic scale.)</i><strong class=\"hmb\"><br><br>Modernized and supercharged. </strong> <br><br>It's been ten years since the original AI War launched, and the gaming world has changed a lot -- as has the available computing power on any device you're using to read this. We've pulled out all the stops to build foes more formidable and intelligent than before, and to create simulations of hundreds of thousands of units running at 120fps in a lot of cases. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, and pause at will. <br><br>The interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Streamlined, yet deeper. </strong> <br><br>Sometimes when a sequel says it's \"streamlined,\" it can really mean \"dumbed down.\" And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to. <br><br>All those bits where you make the interesting strategic decisions? Those bits are tougher than ever, and you can't fall back on old boring habits to muddle through. You need your attention free to anticipate, to plan, to dream... and then throw those all aside and figure it out by the seat of your pants when everything goes sideways. <br><br>There's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element. Clicking fast won't help you. To win the AI War, you'll have to improvise, adapt, and use your wits. <br><br>As it should be. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>How About Some Highlights? </strong> <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Many optional factions, each with their own goals and strategies, create a living galaxy.</li>\n<li>A new Fleets system gives you even more ships than before, and allows you to customize your empire more than ever.</li>\n<li>A ton of map types, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied.</li>\n<li>Outguard to hire, factions to ally with, and oodles of targets to capture or hack --with the AI or aliens.</li>\n<li>Warden, Hunter, and Praetorian Guard sub-fleets of the AI provide for new challenges (and sometimes opportunities) in how both you and the AI interact with each other.</li>\n<li>Crazy moddability, with many levers available in easily-accessible XML.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>What's New Compared To The Original? </strong> <br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>More approachable gameplay, but with a rabbit hole that goes as deep as ever.</li>\n<li>More to do, in terms of moment to moment gameplay and choices.
