With GENE, you can drag, drop, and resize your pictures directly. Moving the pictures is now just a matter of setting a start and end point, along with any changes in transparency you need to make the picture display work perfectly for your scene. You can create as many lines you want on your timeline, adding backgrounds, effects and texts simply by dragging and dropping them at the right points.</p><p>Perfect tool to Preview Scenes\nWant to see how your scene will appear to your players? GENE's preview command is as simple as clicking a play button! You no longer have to pause your eventing just to test how the scene will look. GENE's simplified approach to previewing and editing scenes will ensure that your workflow is more fluid.</p><p>Copy and Paste Back In MV\nWhen opening GENE, you have access to all the images in your RPG Maker MV game - making it easy to pick and choose materials that are already included in your project.

A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands. The government responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite <i>F.E.A.R.</i> (First Encounter Assault Recon) team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances.

As the helicopter which the <i>F.E.A.R.</i> team is on attempts to leave the vicinity, it instead winds up crashing. The <i>F.E.A.R.</i> team is thus forced to seek out an alternate extraction point, all the way battling the now free Alma and her paranormal minions across a destroyed city.\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n   <i>F.E.A.R.</i> Perseus Mandate\n  </strong>\n  As the first <i>F.E.A.R.</i> team and Delta Force fight for control of the situation, a second <i>F.E.A.R.</i> team is sent in to shed some light on Armacham Technology Corporation's (ATC) dark past. As a member of a secondary <i>F.E.A.R.</i> team, you are brought in to discover more information regarding the secret project at the ATC facilities.
