Lair actions are the tool D&amp;D 5th Edition provides you, the Dungeon Master, to make sure that this battle lives up to the hype and anticipation. D&amp;D truly shines when a boss battle is not just a slugfest, but involves the environment and unique obstacles for the player characters to overcome in creative ways. Our goal with Home-Field Advantage is to produce the kind of fun experience your players will still be talking about for years to come.</p><p>Run lair actions at every tier of play. Until now, Lair Actions were treated as something only legendary creatures, usually in the 3rd and 4th tier of play, should have. But in practice, adventurers tend to fight bosses in their lair at every tier of play, and most campaigns end before reaching this legendary stage. With over 170 lairs (almost 70% of the book) for the first two tiers of play, Home-Field Advantage puts the spotlight on the parts of the game people love and experience the most, making them shine even brighter than before.</p><p>Breathe new life into old favorites.

But is one man's steel enough to counter all the magic of fayre?\n\n<i>The Death of the Necromancer</i>\n\nNicholas Valiarde is a passionate, embittered nobleman and the greatest thief in all of Ile-Rien. On the gaslit streets of the city, Nicholas assumes the guise of a master criminal, stealing jewels from wealthy nobles to finance his quest for a long-pursued vengeance.\n\nBut Nicholas's murderous mission is being interrupted by a series of eerie, unexplainable, and fatal events. A dark magic opposes him, and traces of a necromantic power that hasn't been used for centuries abound. Nicholas and his compatriots find themselves battling an ancient evil.\n\nAnd if they lose? Death would be preferable to the fate that awaits them....\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Martha Wells"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"worldcentralkitchen": {"machine_name": "worldcentralkitchen", "youtube_link": "eO18SQJYxcg", "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><em>Donations to support World Central Kitchen are made to the&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183597\">PayPal Giving Fund</a>, subject to its policies.</em></p>\n<p><span>World Central Kitchen (WCK) is a non-profit organization addressing food insecurity during and after natural disasters and humanitarian crises, while also operating long-term programs aimed at improving livelihoods by strengthening local food ecosystems.

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This <strong> Alliance </strong> will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering <strong> Vagabonds </strong> who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods. <br><br>Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling <strong> Eyrie </strong> have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. <br><br>The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take <i>root</i>. <br><br><br>The most recent conquerors of the forest, the <strong> Marquise de Cat </strong> plays a game of engine building and logistics while policing the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to build Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters to help her score victory points. Marquise de Cat has the largest army in <i>ROOT</i>, but numbers alone won\u2019t be enough to secure the forest... <br><br>The Marquise de Cat builds a mighty industrial war machine to subdue the forest. Each time the Marquise builds a Workshop, Sawmill, or Recruiter, you score victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more points scored. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain and protect a strong, interconnected economy of Wood. While it may be tempting to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up. <br><br><br>The <strong> Eyrie Dynasties </strong> once ruled the wood, before the coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming the forest. <br><br>During the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil. <br><br><br>The <strong> Woodland Alliance </strong> doesn\u2019t take kindly to despots - old or new. Marquise, Eyrie, they\u2019re all the same. Only through the will of the people can this wood be ruled! The Woodland Alliance are masters of guerrilla warfare, they begin slowly but can build into a late-game powerhouse - but only if they can manage to subvert the other would-be rulers along the way. <br><br>The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various creatures of the forest. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a base. Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military strength and flexibility. <br><br><br>The <strong> Vagabond </strong> is an adventurer to some, a trader to others, and thief to more, and an all-around scoundrel. As the Vagabond, you will explore all over the map, beyond just it's clearings, into dense woods to find items and ruins. You can trade and lend aid to the warring factions of the forest to help you complete your own secret quests. <br><br>The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves their relationship with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward them, the Vagabond scores victory points. You can also complete quests to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage a pack of items, expand your selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions.", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Dire Wolf", "developer-url": "https://www.direwolfdigital.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "thegameoflife2": {"human_name": "The Game of Life 2", "machine_name": "thegameoflife2", "youtube_link": "eAVmIs6a4GI", "callout": "A modern and updated sequel to the classic board game!

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
