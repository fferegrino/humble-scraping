You will be learning how to use the power of Python to evaluate your recommender systems datasets based on user ratings, user choices, music genres, categories of movies, and their year of release. A practical approach will be adopted to build content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques for recommender systems.nnMoving ahead, you will learn all the basic and necessary concepts for the applied recommender systems models along with the machine learning models. Moreover, various projects have been included in this course to develop a very useful experience for you.nnBy the end of this course, you will be able to relate the concepts and theories for recommender systems in various domains, implement machine learning models for building real-world recommendation systems, and evaluate the machine learning models.nnAll the resource files are added to the GitHub repository at: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Recommender-Systems-with-Machine-Learning</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "AI Sciences", "developer-url": "https://www.packtpub.com/product/recommendersystemswithmachinelearning/9781837631667"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "fundamentalsofmachinelearning": {"human_name": "Fundamentals of Machine Learning", "machine_name": "fundamentalsofmachinelearning", "youtube_link": "C7KDM3wTEyA", "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $60.99</div>", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Packt", "publisher-url": "https://www.packtpub.com/product/fundamentalsofmachinelearning/9781837635719"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 1.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Embark on an in-depth learning journey in machine learning, starting with fundamental concepts like linear regression and logistic regression.

You will also explore deep learning models through neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and learn about dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA. Each lab reinforces the theoretical knowledge, helping you develop a clear understanding of each algorithm and its real-world applications.nIn the final section, the focus shifts to deep learning, with sessions on large language models (LLMs), OpenAI SDK, and LangChain SDK.
