Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!</span><br><br><span>In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!</span><br><br><span>Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely.

Unique yet familiar dice roll inspired movement, encounter and combat mechanics add even more spontaneity and variety as your fortunes rise and fall on the roll of the dice.</p>\n<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For The King II provides a complete campaign with over 30 hours of gameplay, split into 5 separate adventures, each narratively linked.
