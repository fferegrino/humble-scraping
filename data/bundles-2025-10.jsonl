From flowing legatos to animated pizzicatos, from aggressive spiccatos to elegant staccatos, from the most subtle pianissimo to the most triumphant fortissimo and more, Miroslav Philharmonik 2 is a sweeping vision from a master artist embodied in a new virtual instrument that brings the orchestra to life. It\u2019s not enough to just have good recordings of classical instruments. For a true symphonic experience, you need instruments performed by the absolute best musicians articulated in just the right way directed by a producer and conductor who knows the fine art of making living, breathing samples. Miroslav Vitous pioneered the concept of a complete symphonic sample library for real composers, and now he has taken it to the next level.</p><p>Miroslav Philharmonik 2 is feeling. And it's feeling that you can't get with other orchestral collections. Musicians familiar with Mirsolav Vitous' groundbreaking original library know what we're talking about. But if you've never used Miroslav Philharmonik before, let's paint a picture in your mind of the particular kind of feeling that its instruments can conjure: It's the tension and mystery filling your love story set in the French Riviera with delicate tragedy. It's the punctuation and swelling background of passion in your next tear-jerking R&amp;B ballad.</p><p>It's that added dash of symphonic brilliance that turns your goth-metal anthem into the kind of cathartic experience that tops charts. Miroslav Philharmonik 2 is all of these things and more.</p><p>And it\u2019s only possible because of its truly unique sound set. Unlike other libraries, its samples and sounds don't just recreate dry instruments. Instead, Miroslav Philharmonik 2 turns you into a master conductor in control of a full symphony orchestra staffed by living, breathing human beings. So when you call on an instrument to play, you won't just hear a note \u2014 you'll hear all the passion, pain, joy, suffering and excitement of the musician playing that note. And you\u2019ll get it immediately (no processing required). Each of its instruments features multiple musical articulations played by real musicians with the kind of \"live\" feeling that only a master conductor can provoke. From flowing legatos to animated pizzicatos, from aggressive spiccatos to elegant staccatos and from the subtlest pianissimo to the most triumphant fortissimo, Miroslav Philharmonik 2 gives you the power to draw raw musical feeling and emotion from every note.</p><p>Miroslav Philharmonik 2 retains the spirit and musicality of the original Miroslav Philharmonik orchestral workstation used to produce countless major motion picture scores and compositions, and it takes the emotion and expression of the orchestral players to a new level of enlightenment, one that can only be called \u201cmagic\u201d by it\u2019s creator himself.\"</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/philharmonik2/?srsltid=AfmBOoql59-OrAjMrR-r97QTvLNi5v-a1qn7LcJb9WIkBPKmFB46qDjm#nl_form_area"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "mododrum_blackoysterkit": {"human_name": "MODO DRUM - Black Oyster Kit", "machine_name": "mododrum_blackoysterkit", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $49.99</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 20.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>This 4-piece kit is a great choice for classic vintage sound.

The EQ 81 is based on another classic piece of hardware whose character was instrumental in shaping the sound of many hit songs, the EQ 81 can be considered the evolution of its older brother, the EQ 73.</p><p>However, there are a few twists that make the EQ 81 capable of delivering a voice of its own. The key here is in the versatility of the EQ section, sporting four independent bands (high / low shelving, plus two midrange peaking filters) rounded out by high and low pass filters this module is particulary useful when a more precise intervention on a track is needed, still maintaining tone and organic, analog warmth in the signal path. Midrange bands can be switched to high Q for even more selective interventions while the two outer shelving bands can be switched to peaking mode, in case more articulate tone shaping on the frequency spectrum is necessary.</p><p>As in the EQ 73 special attention to detail was paid to the matching of the EQ curves which make this EQ so natural and musical sounding. However, we went a step further: the nature and beauty of these designs resides in the interaction of the preamp circuit with the EQ section so we made sure the behavior of the model was as faithful as possible to the original in this regard, a feature that no other emulation of this classic has taken into account and that makes the EQ 81 (and EQ 73 as well) a step ahead of the pack. There is virtually no audio source this EQ isn't capable of enhancing \u2014 midrange critical sources like vocals, acoustic or electric guitars, will benefit from the extended EQ capabilities, where the key frequencies are precisely tailored to always deliver musical results.</p><p>Obviously given its complete feature set the EQ 81 is at home on any source track like drums, bass, piano and strings.

It's a versatile sonic ninja of a mixing and mastering tool that features an advanced inter-sample peak limiting algorithm that lets you turn up the loudness of your mixes while still maintaining a clean a sound that\u2019s full of dynamic range and sonic breathing room.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter is your new go-to mastering peak limiter when you want impressive loudness without the damaging side effects of traditional processors. The past few decades have seen volume levels rise at an alarming rate. Loudness of mixed and mastered audio material has become a de-facto standard for contemporary music production. This quest for loudness has come at a significant cost \u2014 as producers and engineers strive to remain competitive they employ methods of extreme compression and limiting that, though they make a mix louder, also impart an unmistakable mark of residual distortion, sonic flatness and loss of overall emotion.</p><p>When used heavily, these processors flatten out the music\u2019s dynamics and get rid of much of the music\u2019s magic and emotion when passing between various sections of a song. Our goal was to provide a new kind of processor for the final peak limiting stage of the mastering process that\u2019s able to impart loudness while maintaining more perceived dynamic range than other limiters and compressors. At a basic level, T-RackS Stealth Limiter provides an impressive increase in loudness without the discernable effects of compression. Simply put, it\u2019s the most transparent, clear and loud software mastering peak limiter available. And this is all thanks to its smart level-tracking algorithm.</p><p>It works under the hood to reduce levels below the volume ceiling moment-by-moment instead of applying traditional look-ahead envelope-based fast attack compression. This algorithm doesn\u2019t sound like a compressor, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not a compressor! T-RackS Stealth Limiter\u2019s algorithm tracks the level and keeps it under control while simultaneously preserving the perceived sense of dynamics. With traditional mastering processes, it\u2019s normal to push the volume level towards a -0.1dB or even 0.0dB ceiling. Spikes above this ceiling are suppressed via the use of hard limiters and clippers. Yet these methods only ensure a stable digital level, they do not guarantee undistorted playback once the music is translated into an analog signal. This is because the process of playback involves a number of conversion processes that, though the digital waveform may be below 0.0dB, can cause the analog waveform to exceed this threshold and introduce unwanted distortion and fuzz.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter features an inter-sample peak-limiting algorithm that gets around this issue by predicting the converted analog waveform of the digital source. Through this process it\u2019s able to limit the sound in a way that ensures the final converted audio will very rarely exceed the set ceiling. This is useful in the modern era where music is often heard on different devices and via different services that all deliver their music via compressed formats, like MP3 or AAC. In all cases, it should become apparent that T-RackS Stealth Limiter easily outperforms the competition. In fact, you could say that the T-RackS Stealth Limiter really doesn\u2019t have any competition \u2014 you\u2019ll notice the dynamics of the tracks are less flattened and more respected.</p><p>This is clearly noticable with the Pop Song, where strong emotional contrasts occur when passing between verse and chorus passages. On the Crossover Rock track, T-RackS Stealth Limiter maintains the attack of the drums \u2014 a nuance that's lost by other limiters to varying degrees. And, on the EDM track, T-RackS Stealth Limiter's invisible touch means that the punch and perceived impact is much higher. No matter the situation, T-RackS Stealth Limiter simply sounds cleaner, more open and more detailed than any other limiter currently on the market.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trstealthlimiter/?srsltid=AfmBOor6zqRjxj9C-84Q1BsyRyV4co7sXnUKNjPNAqPlX-Zux8fL8VRF"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "totalstudioessentials": {"human_name": "Total Studio Essentials", "machine_name": "totalstudioessentials", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $500</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>This content&nbsp;<span>includes</span> T-RackS 6, AmpliTube 5 SE, TONEX SE, and SampleTank 4 SE ($500 value)<br><br>T-RackS 6 is a complete mixing and mastering ecosystem with single effects, an al-in-one plug-in and a standalone mastering console.

That's where frequency conscious compression comes to the rescue: setting the De-Esser on the right frequency and threshold will allow to reduce the harshness of too bright cymbals only when they are hit, and with the precise setting of release time the action would be unobtrusive and transparent to the rest of the mix.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trdeesser/?srsltid=AfmBOopWsk7sWdF_TY9MX24uWa2BhVMhpSyr_1rG45StUBV28lqNS2ue"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "modobass_britcustomkit": {"human_name": "MODO DRUM - Brit Custom Kit", "machine_name": "modobass_britcustomkit", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $49.99</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>The Brit Custom is a 4-piece birch kit with a warm and rich sound that makes it perfect for music styles like indie-pop and indie-rock.

Carve your path onto a world, tower by tower, wall by wall, sculpting from the daunting cliffs and perilous waters of an unforgiving landscape that refuses to be tamed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game goals:</h2>\n<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Design fantastic ocean fortress settlements. Progress is simple, grow the populations of various factions and you will progress on their Soultrees. Unlocking commanders and captains that may work for you, unlocking new ships, units and abilities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Your Way:</h2>\n<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Bulwark - Explore the Great Ursee as you build your grand civilisation.

You start at war with every faction, diplomacy is disabled and the frequency and scale of raids is ramped up.

You transport resources along your network of towers as well as trading routes over the sea. Towers and walls within range of the resource can be upgraded and built for free, those out of range cannot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Splinters :</h2>\n<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The currency that powers diplomacy, army building, buying new locations and unique buildings is separate from resources, it runs on a currency called, Splinters. You gain these through population growth, trade with other factions or as rewards from combat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Challenge:</h2>\n<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game challenges you to design and grow grand fortresses, often at little cost other than setting up trade routes for resources. As you grow you may invite in populations from other factions which unlock faction unique content from their \u201csoultree\u201d.</p>\n<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But everybody hates everybody on the Ursee and doing so might lead to war or to loyal allies that merge with your empire.

But this is the end of an age, and great forces are at work. The ancient race known as the Nyueng Bao swear that ancient gods are stirring. the Company's commander has gone mad and flirts with the forces of darkness.

Lightning snarls and barks. Rage is an animate force upon the plain of glittering stone. Even shadows are afraid. At the heart of the plain stands a vast grey stronghold, unknown, older than any written memory. One ancient tower has collapsed across the fissure. From the heart of the fastness comes a great deep slow breath like that of a slumbering world-heart, cracking the olden silence. Death is eternity. Eternity is stone. Stone is silence. Stone cannot speak but stone remembers. So begins the next movement of Glittering Stone....</p><p>The tale again comes to us from the pen of Murgen, Annalist and Standard Bearer of the Black Company, whose developing powers of travel through space and time give him a perspective like no other. Led by the wily commander, Croaker, and the Lady, the Company is working for the Taglian government, but neither the Company nor the Taglians are overflowing with trust for each other. Arrayed against both is a similarly tenuous alliance of sorcerers, including the diabolical Soulcatcher, the psychotic Howler, and a four-year-old child who may be the most powerful of all.</p><p>\u201cWith the Black Company series Glen Cook single-handedly changed the face of fantasy.\u201d\u2014<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Steven Erikson</p><b>Chronicles of The Black Company</b><p> <i>The Black Company </i>(The First Chronicle)</p><p> <i>Shadows Linger </i>(The Second Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The White Rose </i>(The Third Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The Silver Spike</i></p><p> <i>Shadow Games </i>(The First Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Dreams of Steel </i>(The Second Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Bleak Seasons </i>(Book One of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>She Is the Darkness </i>(Book Two of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Water Sleeps </i>(Book Three of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Soldiers Live </i>(Book Four of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Port of Shadows</i></p><p> <i>Lies Weeping </i>(Book One of A Pitiless Rain)</p><p> <b>Omnibus editions:</b></p><p> <i>Chronicles of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>The Black Company</i>, <i>Shadows Linger</i>, and <i>The White Rose</i>)</p><p> <i>The Books of the South</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Shadow Games</i>, <i>Dreams of Steel</i>, and <i>The Silver Spike</i>)</p><p> <i>Return of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Bleak Seasons </i>and <i>She Is the Darkness</i>)</p><p> <i>The Many Deaths of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Water Sleeps </i>and <i>Soldiers Live</i>)</p><p>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Cook, Glen", "developer-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/author/glen-cook/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "soldierslive": {"human_name": "Soldiers Live", "machine_name": "soldierslive", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Publishing Group", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/soldiers-live/?isbn=9781429911115&format=ebook"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><b>From Glen Cook, the godfather of Grimdark, comes the fourth book in the Glittering Stone arc of the  Chronicles of The Black Company\u2014an epic military fantasy series, with millions of copies in print.</b></p><p>When sorcerers and demigods go to war, those wars are fought by mercenaries, \"dog soldiers,\" grunts in the trenches.

As <i>Soldiers Live</i> opens, Croaker is military dictator of all the Taglias, and no Black Company member has died in battle for four years. Croaker figures it can't last. He's right.</p><p>For, of course, many of the Company's old adversaries are still around. Narayan Singh and his adopted daughter--actually the offspring of Croaker and the Lady--hope to bring about the apocalyptic Year of the Skulls. Other old enemies like Shadowcatcher, Longshadow, and Howler are also ready to do the Company harm. And much of the Company is still recovering from the fifteen years many of them spent in a stasis field.</p><p>Then a report arrives of an evil spirit, a forvalaka, that has taken over one of their old enemies. It attacks them at a shadowgate--setting off a chain of events that will bring the Company to the edge of apocalypse and, as usual, several steps beyond.</p><p>\u201cWith the Black Company series Glen Cook single-handedly changed the face of fantasy.\u201d\u2014<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Steven Erikson</p><b>Chronicles of The Black Company</b><p> <i>The Black Company </i>(The First Chronicle)</p><p> <i>Shadows Linger </i>(The Second Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The White Rose </i>(The Third Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The Silver Spike</i></p><p> <i>Shadow Games </i>(The First Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Dreams of Steel </i>(The Second Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Bleak Seasons </i>(Book One of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>She Is the Darkness </i>(Book Two of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Water Sleeps </i>(Book Three of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Soldiers Live </i>(Book Four of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Port of Shadows</i></p><p> <i>Lies Weeping </i>(Book One of A Pitiless Rain)</p><p> <b>Omnibus editions:</b></p><p> <i>Chronicles of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>The Black Company</i>, <i>Shadows Linger</i>, and <i>The White Rose</i>)</p><p> <i>The Books of the South</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Shadow Games</i>, <i>Dreams of Steel</i>, and <i>The Silver Spike</i>)</p><p> <i>Return of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Bleak Seasons </i>and <i>She Is the Darkness</i>)</p><p> <i>The Many Deaths of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Water Sleeps </i>and <i>Soldiers Live</i>)</p><p>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Cook, Glen", "developer-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/author/glen-cook/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "lordofthesilentkingdom": {"human_name": "Lord of the Silent Kingdom", "machine_name": "lordofthesilentkingdom", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Publishing Group", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/lord-of-the-silent-kingdom/?isbn=9780765326058&format=trade"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Following <i>The Tyranny of the Night</i> (Tor hc, June 2005), the second volume of The Instrumentalities of the Night</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Cook, Glen", "developer-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/author/glen-cook/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "workinggodsmischief": {"human_name": "Working God's Mischief", "machine_name": "workinggodsmischief", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Publishing Group", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/working-gods-mischief/?isbn=9781466809079&format=ebook"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Arnhand, Castauriga, and Navaya lost their kings.

After your unit's boat shipwrecks, you find yourself cast on an island controlled by the Wokou, Japanese pirates that have been terrorizing the Chinese coasts for decades. You are alone with your sword, <i>the last soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> standing against the pirates \u2013 but your duty won't be fulfilled until your people's coasts are safe again. <br><br>Explore the beautifully painted landscapes of Fuling Island to defeat the 5 pirate bosses, each with their own unique characteristics, experiencing the most intense traditional melee combat. Embrace the challenge of this hardcore action game, rich in historical charm and martial arts depth! <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Fighting against Japanese pirates </strong> <br><i>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> is set during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, rampant Japanese pirates plagued the southeastern coastal regions. General Qi Jiguang was tasked with combating these pirates; after successfully finishing his campaign, he headed north to Jizhou, pacifying internal rebellions in his path and guarding against external barbarians. But as the Qi's army moved north, the remnants of the defeated Japanese pirates gathered back its forces and conspired with other sea raiders from Fuling Island, readying to make a bloody comeback. <br><br>As a member of the Qi's army stationed to guard the coastal regions, specifically tasked with pacifying the seas, you were patrolling the waters when a storm shipwrecked your boat \u2013 and you find yourself a castaway on the shores of Ryukyu Island, the only survivor of your unit. With your sword by your side, you walk into the depths of the Island, set on uncovering and dismantling the clandestine plots of the Japanese pirates. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Ink and wash painting world </strong> <br>The game's art is inspired by traditional Chinese ink and wash paintings. From the humblest blade of grass to the most majestic mountains of Fuling Island, each scene is beautifully painted in ink and wash. Its artistic design also draws inspiration from ancient Chinese paintings' character styles and proportions, providing players with a captivating visual experience. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Tactical melee with cold weapons </strong> <br><i>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> will put your reflexes and warrior senses to the test. Its combat system is built upon three basic attack actions: stab, cleave, and sweep, which form the basis of both offense and defense. While executing these moves, it is crucial to discern the enemy's attacks simultaneously. You can deflect their attacks by accurately anticipating the enemy's actions. Stay calm in the midst of the storm while you ponder the enemy's every move, and you will remain undefeated in battle. <br><br>The game offers a variety of combat styles, ranging from close-quarters melee weapons to long-range bows and arrows. You can either block enemy attacks with your weapons or utilize evading maneuvers and counterattacks. The key to overcoming adversaries lies in swiftly switching between offense and defense, adeptly countering their moves. Only by mastering the art of adaptation and switching styles you will ultimately triumph over your foes. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Historical weaponry and armor </strong> <br>The game offers a variety of weapons and equipment for players to choose from. Each piece of weaponry is meticulously recreated to reflect its origins in real historical contexts. <br><br>You can also disarm enemies and utilize their weapon skills against them. Through diligent practice, mastering the techniques of your adversaries, and then applying them to your own weaponry, you will become even more formidable in combat. <br><br><span> </span>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Circuit_Art"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "dwarvenrealms": {"human_name": "Dwarven Realms", "machine_name": "dwarvenrealms", "youtube_link": "yadCNLul3MM", "callout": "82% Positive on Steam<br><br>Lead a party of heroes on a quest to reclaim ancient dwarven kingdoms swallowed by darkness.

The Indonesian&nbsp;<strong>Babi Ngepet</strong>&nbsp;myth tells of sorcerors who sacrifice their humanity in order to become boar demons. The tales of&nbsp;<strong>Hungry Ghosts</strong>&nbsp;are superstitions brought over by Chinese immigrants - undead horrors cursed to remain forever hungry due to their greed in mortal life.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Stories from the maritime region of Southeast-Asia are full of all manner of nightmarish, horrifying creatures. Are you brave enough to face them?&nbsp;<strong>Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.</strong><br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Explore a procedurally generated world</strong>&nbsp;that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Players unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food!&nbsp;<strong>Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats.</strong>&nbsp;Don't fight on an empty stomach!<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Ghostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero.</strong>&nbsp;The 6 classes are:<br></span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li><strong>The Adept:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.</li>\n<li><strong>The Exorcist:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.</li>\n<li><strong>The Feral:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.</li>\n<li><strong>The Geomancer:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.</li>\n<li><strong>The Hashashin:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.</li>\n<li><strong>The Sentinel:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>BUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM</strong><br><span>Each class comes with a \u201cskill set\u201d, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Skill modifiers</strong>&nbsp;can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs. For example:<br></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>Some skill modifiers are&nbsp;<strong>trigger modifiers</strong>. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier\u2019s specified conditions are met. Examples:<br></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong><br>COMBO SKILLS</strong><br></span><span>Each active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills.</span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">The Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><i>The glyphs are based on the Toki Pona language, designed by Sonja Lang.</i><br></span><br><span>Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.</span><br><br><span>Here's where things get interesting:&nbsp;</span><strong>Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration.</strong><span>&nbsp;Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:</span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kris</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Keris</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>- a blade with a distinctively wavy shape.

Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:<br></span><br><strong>Spirits</strong><span>&nbsp;inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the&nbsp;</span><strong>Psychic</strong><span>&nbsp;to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.</span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>In Southeast Asian folklore, the&nbsp;<strong>Orang Bunian</strong>&nbsp;are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels. On rare occasion, they will bless your items with new, random properties.</span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br></span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li><strong>Local co-op multiplier</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>lets you play with up to 4 of your friends on the same screen.</li>\n<li><strong>Steam workshop support</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>allows you to customise your experience with mods from the community.</li>\n<li><strong>The Shrine of Balance</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is an optional asynchronous multiplayer feature which lets you help other players by sending them equipment.

As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.82, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Very Positive", "steam_count": 12337}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Fatshark", "developer-url": "http://www.fatsharkgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "warhammer40000_battlesector": {"human_name": "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector", "machine_name": "warhammer40000_battlesector", "youtube_link": "nVsCATpZloc", "callout": "<span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Live &amp; Asynchronous Multiplayer</span>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 12.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<i>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</i> is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millenium.
