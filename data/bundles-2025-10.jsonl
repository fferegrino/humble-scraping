Lightning snarls and barks. Rage is an animate force upon the plain of glittering stone. Even shadows are afraid. At the heart of the plain stands a vast grey stronghold, unknown, older than any written memory. One ancient tower has collapsed across the fissure. From the heart of the fastness comes a great deep slow breath like that of a slumbering world-heart, cracking the olden silence. Death is eternity. Eternity is stone. Stone is silence. Stone cannot speak but stone remembers. So begins the next movement of Glittering Stone....</p><p>The tale again comes to us from the pen of Murgen, Annalist and Standard Bearer of the Black Company, whose developing powers of travel through space and time give him a perspective like no other. Led by the wily commander, Croaker, and the Lady, the Company is working for the Taglian government, but neither the Company nor the Taglians are overflowing with trust for each other. Arrayed against both is a similarly tenuous alliance of sorcerers, including the diabolical Soulcatcher, the psychotic Howler, and a four-year-old child who may be the most powerful of all.</p><p>\u201cWith the Black Company series Glen Cook single-handedly changed the face of fantasy.\u201d\u2014<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Steven Erikson</p><b>Chronicles of The Black Company</b><p> <i>The Black Company </i>(The First Chronicle)</p><p> <i>Shadows Linger </i>(The Second Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The White Rose </i>(The Third Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The Silver Spike</i></p><p> <i>Shadow Games </i>(The First Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Dreams of Steel </i>(The Second Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Bleak Seasons </i>(Book One of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>She Is the Darkness </i>(Book Two of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Water Sleeps </i>(Book Three of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Soldiers Live </i>(Book Four of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Port of Shadows</i></p><p> <i>Lies Weeping </i>(Book One of A Pitiless Rain)</p><p> <b>Omnibus editions:</b></p><p> <i>Chronicles of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>The Black Company</i>, <i>Shadows Linger</i>, and <i>The White Rose</i>)</p><p> <i>The Books of the South</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Shadow Games</i>, <i>Dreams of Steel</i>, and <i>The Silver Spike</i>)</p><p> <i>Return of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Bleak Seasons </i>and <i>She Is the Darkness</i>)</p><p> <i>The Many Deaths of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Water Sleeps </i>and <i>Soldiers Live</i>)</p><p>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Cook, Glen", "developer-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/author/glen-cook/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "soldierslive": {"human_name": "Soldiers Live", "machine_name": "soldierslive", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Publishing Group", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/soldiers-live/?isbn=9781429911115&format=ebook"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><b>From Glen Cook, the godfather of Grimdark, comes the fourth book in the Glittering Stone arc of the  Chronicles of The Black Company\u2014an epic military fantasy series, with millions of copies in print.</b></p><p>When sorcerers and demigods go to war, those wars are fought by mercenaries, \"dog soldiers,\" grunts in the trenches.

He's right.</p><p>For, of course, many of the Company's old adversaries are still around. Narayan Singh and his adopted daughter--actually the offspring of Croaker and the Lady--hope to bring about the apocalyptic Year of the Skulls. Other old enemies like Shadowcatcher, Longshadow, and Howler are also ready to do the Company harm. And much of the Company is still recovering from the fifteen years many of them spent in a stasis field.</p><p>Then a report arrives of an evil spirit, a forvalaka, that has taken over one of their old enemies.

After your unit's boat shipwrecks, you find yourself cast on an island controlled by the Wokou, Japanese pirates that have been terrorizing the Chinese coasts for decades. You are alone with your sword, <i>the last soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> standing against the pirates \u2013 but your duty won't be fulfilled until your people's coasts are safe again. <br><br>Explore the beautifully painted landscapes of Fuling Island to defeat the 5 pirate bosses, each with their own unique characteristics, experiencing the most intense traditional melee combat. Embrace the challenge of this hardcore action game, rich in historical charm and martial arts depth! <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Fighting against Japanese pirates </strong> <br><i>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> is set during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, rampant Japanese pirates plagued the southeastern coastal regions. General Qi Jiguang was tasked with combating these pirates; after successfully finishing his campaign, he headed north to Jizhou, pacifying internal rebellions in his path and guarding against external barbarians. But as the Qi's army moved north, the remnants of the defeated Japanese pirates gathered back its forces and conspired with other sea raiders from Fuling Island, readying to make a bloody comeback. <br><br>As a member of the Qi's army stationed to guard the coastal regions, specifically tasked with pacifying the seas, you were patrolling the waters when a storm shipwrecked your boat \u2013 and you find yourself a castaway on the shores of Ryukyu Island, the only survivor of your unit. With your sword by your side, you walk into the depths of the Island, set on uncovering and dismantling the clandestine plots of the Japanese pirates. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Ink and wash painting world </strong> <br>The game's art is inspired by traditional Chinese ink and wash paintings. From the humblest blade of grass to the most majestic mountains of Fuling Island, each scene is beautifully painted in ink and wash. Its artistic design also draws inspiration from ancient Chinese paintings' character styles and proportions, providing players with a captivating visual experience. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Tactical melee with cold weapons </strong> <br><i>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> will put your reflexes and warrior senses to the test. Its combat system is built upon three basic attack actions: stab, cleave, and sweep, which form the basis of both offense and defense. While executing these moves, it is crucial to discern the enemy's attacks simultaneously. You can deflect their attacks by accurately anticipating the enemy's actions. Stay calm in the midst of the storm while you ponder the enemy's every move, and you will remain undefeated in battle. <br><br>The game offers a variety of combat styles, ranging from close-quarters melee weapons to long-range bows and arrows. You can either block enemy attacks with your weapons or utilize evading maneuvers and counterattacks. The key to overcoming adversaries lies in swiftly switching between offense and defense, adeptly countering their moves. Only by mastering the art of adaptation and switching styles you will ultimately triumph over your foes. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Historical weaponry and armor </strong> <br>The game offers a variety of weapons and equipment for players to choose from. Each piece of weaponry is meticulously recreated to reflect its origins in real historical contexts. <br><br>You can also disarm enemies and utilize their weapon skills against them. Through diligent practice, mastering the techniques of your adversaries, and then applying them to your own weaponry, you will become even more formidable in combat. <br><br><span> </span>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Circuit_Art"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "dwarvenrealms": {"human_name": "Dwarven Realms", "machine_name": "dwarvenrealms", "youtube_link": "yadCNLul3MM", "callout": "82% Positive on Steam<br><br>Lead a party of heroes on a quest to reclaim ancient dwarven kingdoms swallowed by darkness.

Are you brave enough to face them?&nbsp;<strong>Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.</strong><br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Explore a procedurally generated world</strong>&nbsp;that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Players unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food!&nbsp;<strong>Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats.</strong>&nbsp;Don't fight on an empty stomach!<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Ghostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero.</strong>&nbsp;The 6 classes are:<br></span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li><strong>The Adept:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.</li>\n<li><strong>The Exorcist:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.</li>\n<li><strong>The Feral:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.</li>\n<li><strong>The Geomancer:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.</li>\n<li><strong>The Hashashin:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.</li>\n<li><strong>The Sentinel:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>BUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM</strong><br><span>Each class comes with a \u201cskill set\u201d, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Skill modifiers</strong>&nbsp;can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs. For example:<br></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>Some skill modifiers are&nbsp;<strong>trigger modifiers</strong>. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier\u2019s specified conditions are met. Examples:<br></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong><br>COMBO SKILLS</strong><br></span><span>Each active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills.</span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">The Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><i>The glyphs are based on the Toki Pona language, designed by Sonja Lang.</i><br></span><br><span>Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.</span><br><br><span>Here's where things get interesting:&nbsp;</span><strong>Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration.</strong><span>&nbsp;Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:</span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kris</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Keris</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>- a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.</li>\n<li>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Bow and Arrow</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!</li>\n<li><strong>Parangs</strong>, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.</li>\n<li>The deadly<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kukri</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.</li>\n<li>The trusty<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Spear</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.</li>\n<li>Finally, there are enchanted<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Talismans</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><span>In addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:<br></span><br><strong>Spirits</strong><span>&nbsp;inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the&nbsp;</span><strong>Psychic</strong><span>&nbsp;to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.</span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>In Southeast Asian folklore, the&nbsp;<strong>Orang Bunian</strong>&nbsp;are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels.

As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.82, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Very Positive", "steam_count": 12337}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Fatshark", "developer-url": "http://www.fatsharkgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "warhammer40000_battlesector": {"human_name": "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector", "machine_name": "warhammer40000_battlesector", "youtube_link": "nVsCATpZloc", "callout": "<span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Live &amp; Asynchronous Multiplayer</span>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 12.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<i>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</i> is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millenium.
