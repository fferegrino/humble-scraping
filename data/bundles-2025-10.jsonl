One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.82, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Very Positive", "steam_count": 12337}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Fatshark", "developer-url": "http://www.fatsharkgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "warhammer40000_battlesector": {"human_name": "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector", "machine_name": "warhammer40000_battlesector", "youtube_link": "nVsCATpZloc", "callout": "<span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Live &amp; Asynchronous Multiplayer</span>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 12.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<i>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</i> is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millenium.
