The Dark Gods are at last united in a singular purpose, losing their madness across the world as never before. In the Empire of Sigmar, Karl Franz's gaze is focused on the incursion of the savage northmen, but it is not the only threat. As the Chaos moon Morrslieb waxes full, shrill voices echo through tunnels gnawed far beneath the Empire's cities, and a Skaven host swarms towards the surface. It emerges first in the city of Ubersreik, a screeching mass that consumes all before it. Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. <br><br>Yet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.82, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Very Positive", "steam_count": 12337}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Fatshark", "developer-url": "http://www.fatsharkgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "warhammer40000_battlesector": {"human_name": "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector", "machine_name": "warhammer40000_battlesector", "youtube_link": "nVsCATpZloc", "callout": "<span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Live &amp; Asynchronous Multiplayer</span>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 12.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<i>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</i> is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millenium.
