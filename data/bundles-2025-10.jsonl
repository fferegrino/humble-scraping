The game came out on PC late last year and has provided hundreds of thousands of people with a solid way to spend some time in a faraway fantasy land, exploring, discovering and surviving. So, you know\u2026 a fun game!</p>\n<p><strong>What is the game about?</strong></p>\n<p>Good question! One approach to it would we to try to compile some sort of feature list, but what does that really tell you. Another way to address this question is to talk about the emotional journey and experience that <em>Kingdom: New Lands</em> offers.</p>\n<p>It is about exploration, discovery, survival and that awesome feeling that you get, when you figure something out, on your own. When multiple pieces all of a sudden come together to form a whole \u2013 a basis for a new strategy or an understanding how something in the world of <em>Kingdom: New Lands</em> truly works.</p>\n<p>It is about tenacity and overcoming obstacles \u2013 even when they seem to be unsurmountable. Pulling through, against all odds. Rebuilding and recovering. And that huge internal high-five when you succeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is about figuring out how best to manage your little Kingdom and tie everything together in a fashion where the game doesn\u2019t play you \u2013 you play the game.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also beautiful, tranquil, melancholy, frantic, stressful and wonderful. It delivers a spectrum of emotions that combine into a unique experience.</p>\n<p>It's a minimalist strategy game where you need to discover the rules of how the world behaves before you can rule effectively. It's also a little bit whimsical, it's pretty, and it can be frustrating but it won't hold your hand.</p>\n<p><strong>But What\u2019s New?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kingdom: New Lands</em> introduces a lot of new things and builds on the original <em>Kingdom</em> game. It changes the end game significantly. It\u2019s loaded with new elements, new things to discover and explore. It meets a lot of requests for new features, suggested improvements and general feedback from the incredible and wonderful community that has embraced the world of <em>Kingdom</em> and stuck with the game since the launch of the original title \u2013 and even further back, when the earliest iteration of <em>Kingdom</em> was a Flash based browser game, enjoyed by an incredible number of people.</p>\n<p>So, for anyone that has played Kingdom before, Kingdom: New Lands will introduce many new elements that revitalize the experience. New players will find a bigger, deeper world than the original <em>Kingdom</em> (now called <em>Kingdom: Classic</em>) had to offer.</p>\n<p>We hope you try out the game and enjoy playing it, as much as we\u2019ve enjoyed getting it into your hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Tales spread of far off isles with mysteries waiting to be discovered. Rulers will need all the strength of their subjects to sail away and find new kingdoms in these New Lands.</p>\n<p><em>Kingdom: New Lands</em> builds upon the award-winning gameplay and mystery of <em>Kingdom</em> by introducing an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy. Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you.</p>\n<p>Be brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Noio", "developer-url": "http://www.noio.nl/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "kingdom_twocrowns_ost": {"human_name": "Kingdom Two Crowns: OST", "machine_name": "kingdom_twocrowns_ost", "youtube_link": "ZUWuhZmpXmI", "callout": "Relive your favorite moments with the complete collection of all iconic musical pieces.", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Raw Fury", "publisher-url": "http://rawfury.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 13.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<div><strong>Kingdom Two Crowns Original Soundtrack</strong> contains the beautiful music composed by Amos Roddy and the Norse Lands soundtrack composed by Kalandra.\u00a0<br><br></div>\n<div><strong>Kingdom Two Crowns:</strong><br><br></div>\n<div>01.

(this course can be found on our store) 3DsMax, Blender, Substance Painter, and Marmoset Toolbag 4 During this course, you'll learn how to create high-quality 3D characters using various industry-standard software packages. Retopology and UV mapping will be carried out in 3DsMax. However, the techniques used are universal and can be applied to other 3D modeling software as well. Baking will be done in Marmoset Toolbag, and texturing will be done in Substance Painter. We'll create a simple rig for posing with Actorcore Accurig, which we'll adjust in Blender. We'll generate hair cards in Blender and render the final model in Marmoset Toolbag 4, ZBrush will also be used for a few short segments, but it's not essential for this course.

For almost a decade, we've been working on a worthy successor to the fan-acclaimed Primordia , and we are proud, at long last, to share our second game. <br><br>Strangeland is a place like no other. Even in the real world, carnivals occupy a twilight territory between the fantastic and the mundane, the alien and the familiar. In their funhouse mirrors, their freaks, and their frauds, we see hideous and haunting reflections of ourselves, and we witness the wonder and horror of humanity in just a few frayed tents, peeling circus wagons, dingy booths, and run-down rides. Strangeland , of course, is most definitely not the real world. Indeed, figuring out where\u2014and who\u2014you are is one of the game's many mysteries. <br><br>As you explore Strangeland , you will need to gather otherworldly tools and win strange allies to overcome a daunting array of obstacles. Forge a blade from iron stolen from the jaws of a ravenous hound and hone it with wrath and grief; charm the eye out of a ten-legged teratoma; and ride a giant cicada to the edge of oblivion.... Amidst such madness, death itself has no grip on you, and you will wield that slippery immortality to gain an edge over your foes. <br><br>Navigating this domain of monsters and metaphors will require understanding its denizens and its enigmas. Unlike many adventure games that offer a linear experience and single-solution puzzles, Strangeland lets you pick your own way, your own approach, and your own meaning\u2014one player might win a carnival game with sharpshooting, another by electrical engineering; one player might unravel a strange prophet's wordplay while another gathers visual clues scattered throughout the environment. Ultimately, Strangeland 's story will be your story.

From flowing legatos to animated pizzicatos, from aggressive spiccatos to elegant staccatos, from the most subtle pianissimo to the most triumphant fortissimo and more, Miroslav Philharmonik 2 is a sweeping vision from a master artist embodied in a new virtual instrument that brings the orchestra to life. It\u2019s not enough to just have good recordings of classical instruments. For a true symphonic experience, you need instruments performed by the absolute best musicians articulated in just the right way directed by a producer and conductor who knows the fine art of making living, breathing samples. Miroslav Vitous pioneered the concept of a complete symphonic sample library for real composers, and now he has taken it to the next level.</p><p>Miroslav Philharmonik 2 is feeling. And it's feeling that you can't get with other orchestral collections. Musicians familiar with Mirsolav Vitous' groundbreaking original library know what we're talking about. But if you've never used Miroslav Philharmonik before, let's paint a picture in your mind of the particular kind of feeling that its instruments can conjure: It's the tension and mystery filling your love story set in the French Riviera with delicate tragedy. It's the punctuation and swelling background of passion in your next tear-jerking R&amp;B ballad.</p><p>It's that added dash of symphonic brilliance that turns your goth-metal anthem into the kind of cathartic experience that tops charts. Miroslav Philharmonik 2 is all of these things and more.</p><p>And it\u2019s only possible because of its truly unique sound set. Unlike other libraries, its samples and sounds don't just recreate dry instruments. Instead, Miroslav Philharmonik 2 turns you into a master conductor in control of a full symphony orchestra staffed by living, breathing human beings. So when you call on an instrument to play, you won't just hear a note \u2014 you'll hear all the passion, pain, joy, suffering and excitement of the musician playing that note. And you\u2019ll get it immediately (no processing required). Each of its instruments features multiple musical articulations played by real musicians with the kind of \"live\" feeling that only a master conductor can provoke. From flowing legatos to animated pizzicatos, from aggressive spiccatos to elegant staccatos and from the subtlest pianissimo to the most triumphant fortissimo, Miroslav Philharmonik 2 gives you the power to draw raw musical feeling and emotion from every note.</p><p>Miroslav Philharmonik 2 retains the spirit and musicality of the original Miroslav Philharmonik orchestral workstation used to produce countless major motion picture scores and compositions, and it takes the emotion and expression of the orchestral players to a new level of enlightenment, one that can only be called \u201cmagic\u201d by it\u2019s creator himself.\"</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/philharmonik2/?srsltid=AfmBOoql59-OrAjMrR-r97QTvLNi5v-a1qn7LcJb9WIkBPKmFB46qDjm#nl_form_area"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "mododrum_blackoysterkit": {"human_name": "MODO DRUM - Black Oyster Kit", "machine_name": "mododrum_blackoysterkit", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $49.99</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 20.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>This 4-piece kit is a great choice for classic vintage sound.

However, we went a step further: the nature and beauty of these designs resides in the interaction of the preamp circuit with the EQ section so we made sure the behavior of the model was as faithful as possible to the original in this regard, a feature that no other emulation of this classic has taken into account and that makes the EQ 81 (and EQ 73 as well) a step ahead of the pack. There is virtually no audio source this EQ isn't capable of enhancing \u2014 midrange critical sources like vocals, acoustic or electric guitars, will benefit from the extended EQ capabilities, where the key frequencies are precisely tailored to always deliver musical results.</p><p>Obviously given its complete feature set the EQ 81 is at home on any source track like drums, bass, piano and strings.

It's a versatile sonic ninja of a mixing and mastering tool that features an advanced inter-sample peak limiting algorithm that lets you turn up the loudness of your mixes while still maintaining a clean a sound that\u2019s full of dynamic range and sonic breathing room.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter is your new go-to mastering peak limiter when you want impressive loudness without the damaging side effects of traditional processors. The past few decades have seen volume levels rise at an alarming rate. Loudness of mixed and mastered audio material has become a de-facto standard for contemporary music production. This quest for loudness has come at a significant cost \u2014 as producers and engineers strive to remain competitive they employ methods of extreme compression and limiting that, though they make a mix louder, also impart an unmistakable mark of residual distortion, sonic flatness and loss of overall emotion.</p><p>When used heavily, these processors flatten out the music\u2019s dynamics and get rid of much of the music\u2019s magic and emotion when passing between various sections of a song. Our goal was to provide a new kind of processor for the final peak limiting stage of the mastering process that\u2019s able to impart loudness while maintaining more perceived dynamic range than other limiters and compressors. At a basic level, T-RackS Stealth Limiter provides an impressive increase in loudness without the discernable effects of compression. Simply put, it\u2019s the most transparent, clear and loud software mastering peak limiter available. And this is all thanks to its smart level-tracking algorithm.</p><p>It works under the hood to reduce levels below the volume ceiling moment-by-moment instead of applying traditional look-ahead envelope-based fast attack compression. This algorithm doesn\u2019t sound like a compressor, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not a compressor! T-RackS Stealth Limiter\u2019s algorithm tracks the level and keeps it under control while simultaneously preserving the perceived sense of dynamics. With traditional mastering processes, it\u2019s normal to push the volume level towards a -0.1dB or even 0.0dB ceiling. Spikes above this ceiling are suppressed via the use of hard limiters and clippers. Yet these methods only ensure a stable digital level, they do not guarantee undistorted playback once the music is translated into an analog signal. This is because the process of playback involves a number of conversion processes that, though the digital waveform may be below 0.0dB, can cause the analog waveform to exceed this threshold and introduce unwanted distortion and fuzz.</p><p>T-RackS Stealth Limiter features an inter-sample peak-limiting algorithm that gets around this issue by predicting the converted analog waveform of the digital source. Through this process it\u2019s able to limit the sound in a way that ensures the final converted audio will very rarely exceed the set ceiling. This is useful in the modern era where music is often heard on different devices and via different services that all deliver their music via compressed formats, like MP3 or AAC. In all cases, it should become apparent that T-RackS Stealth Limiter easily outperforms the competition. In fact, you could say that the T-RackS Stealth Limiter really doesn\u2019t have any competition \u2014 you\u2019ll notice the dynamics of the tracks are less flattened and more respected.</p><p>This is clearly noticable with the Pop Song, where strong emotional contrasts occur when passing between verse and chorus passages. On the Crossover Rock track, T-RackS Stealth Limiter maintains the attack of the drums \u2014 a nuance that's lost by other limiters to varying degrees. And, on the EDM track, T-RackS Stealth Limiter's invisible touch means that the punch and perceived impact is much higher. No matter the situation, T-RackS Stealth Limiter simply sounds cleaner, more open and more detailed than any other limiter currently on the market.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "IK Multimedia", "developer-url": "https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trstealthlimiter/?srsltid=AfmBOor6zqRjxj9C-84Q1BsyRyV4co7sXnUKNjPNAqPlX-Zux8fL8VRF"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "totalstudioessentials": {"human_name": "Total Studio Essentials", "machine_name": "totalstudioessentials", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">MSRP: $500</div>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>This content&nbsp;<span>includes</span> T-RackS 6, AmpliTube 5 SE, TONEX SE, and SampleTank 4 SE ($500 value)<br><br>T-RackS 6 is a complete mixing and mastering ecosystem with single effects, an al-in-one plug-in and a standalone mastering console.

The actual notes themselves had to be performed in a very specific way that when translated to the keyboard or in MIDI patterns still sounded like an amazing acoustic guitar played by a great guitarist. We always kept the top priority of making a true \u201cmusical\u201d instrument and not just a perfect recording. The result is a spectacularly natural sounding instrument made for music.</p><p>American Acoustic is a comprehensive library of acoustic guitar sounds, with a huge selection of instruments that cover every method of playing from flatpicking, fingerstyle, strumming and beyond. You can even add additional effects like slides and harmonics.</p><p>American Acoustic also includes a generous selection of patterns using different articulations including strumming techniques. Combine this versatility with its number of ensemble and experimental combo instruments, and you have an instrument that's a perfect fit for Pop, Rock, Folk, Country, Hip-Hop, R&amp;B and even EDM. Now, no matter what genre you favor, you can have great sounding acoustic guitars at the touch of a button.

The cunning strategist has gathered the powerful remnants of the Empire\u2019s war machine, preparing to execute the late Emperor Palpatine\u2019s final plan. As the Imperial fleet orbits Jakku, an armada of Republic fighters closes in to finish what began at Endor. Norra and her crew soar into the heart of an apocalyptic clash that will leave land and sky alike scorched.

Lightning snarls and barks. Rage is an animate force upon the plain of glittering stone. Even shadows are afraid. At the heart of the plain stands a vast grey stronghold, unknown, older than any written memory. One ancient tower has collapsed across the fissure. From the heart of the fastness comes a great deep slow breath like that of a slumbering world-heart, cracking the olden silence. Death is eternity. Eternity is stone. Stone is silence. Stone cannot speak but stone remembers. So begins the next movement of Glittering Stone....</p><p>The tale again comes to us from the pen of Murgen, Annalist and Standard Bearer of the Black Company, whose developing powers of travel through space and time give him a perspective like no other. Led by the wily commander, Croaker, and the Lady, the Company is working for the Taglian government, but neither the Company nor the Taglians are overflowing with trust for each other. Arrayed against both is a similarly tenuous alliance of sorcerers, including the diabolical Soulcatcher, the psychotic Howler, and a four-year-old child who may be the most powerful of all.</p><p>\u201cWith the Black Company series Glen Cook single-handedly changed the face of fantasy.\u201d\u2014<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Steven Erikson</p><b>Chronicles of The Black Company</b><p> <i>The Black Company </i>(The First Chronicle)</p><p> <i>Shadows Linger </i>(The Second Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The White Rose </i>(The Third Chronicle)</p><p> <i>The Silver Spike</i></p><p> <i>Shadow Games </i>(The First Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Dreams of Steel </i>(The Second Book of the South)</p><p> <i>Bleak Seasons </i>(Book One of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>She Is the Darkness </i>(Book Two of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Water Sleeps </i>(Book Three of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Soldiers Live </i>(Book Four of Glittering Stone)</p><p> <i>Port of Shadows</i></p><p> <i>Lies Weeping </i>(Book One of A Pitiless Rain)</p><p> <b>Omnibus editions:</b></p><p> <i>Chronicles of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>The Black Company</i>, <i>Shadows Linger</i>, and <i>The White Rose</i>)</p><p> <i>The Books of the South</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Shadow Games</i>, <i>Dreams of Steel</i>, and <i>The Silver Spike</i>)</p><p> <i>Return of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Bleak Seasons </i>and <i>She Is the Darkness</i>)</p><p> <i>The Many Deaths of the Black Company</i></p><p> (comprising <i>Water Sleeps </i>and <i>Soldiers Live</i>)</p><p>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Cook, Glen", "developer-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/author/glen-cook/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "soldierslive": {"human_name": "Soldiers Live", "machine_name": "soldierslive", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Publishing Group", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/soldiers-live/?isbn=9781429911115&format=ebook"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><b>From Glen Cook, the godfather of Grimdark, comes the fourth book in the Glittering Stone arc of the  Chronicles of The Black Company\u2014an epic military fantasy series, with millions of copies in print.</b></p><p>When sorcerers and demigods go to war, those wars are fought by mercenaries, \"dog soldiers,\" grunts in the trenches.

He's right.</p><p>For, of course, many of the Company's old adversaries are still around. Narayan Singh and his adopted daughter--actually the offspring of Croaker and the Lady--hope to bring about the apocalyptic Year of the Skulls. Other old enemies like Shadowcatcher, Longshadow, and Howler are also ready to do the Company harm. And much of the Company is still recovering from the fifteen years many of them spent in a stasis field.</p><p>Then a report arrives of an evil spirit, a forvalaka, that has taken over one of their old enemies.

After your unit's boat shipwrecks, you find yourself cast on an island controlled by the Wokou, Japanese pirates that have been terrorizing the Chinese coasts for decades. You are alone with your sword, <i>the last soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> standing against the pirates \u2013 but your duty won't be fulfilled until your people's coasts are safe again. <br><br>Explore the beautifully painted landscapes of Fuling Island to defeat the 5 pirate bosses, each with their own unique characteristics, experiencing the most intense traditional melee combat. Embrace the challenge of this hardcore action game, rich in historical charm and martial arts depth! <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Fighting against Japanese pirates </strong> <br><i>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> is set during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, rampant Japanese pirates plagued the southeastern coastal regions. General Qi Jiguang was tasked with combating these pirates; after successfully finishing his campaign, he headed north to Jizhou, pacifying internal rebellions in his path and guarding against external barbarians. But as the Qi's army moved north, the remnants of the defeated Japanese pirates gathered back its forces and conspired with other sea raiders from Fuling Island, readying to make a bloody comeback. <br><br>As a member of the Qi's army stationed to guard the coastal regions, specifically tasked with pacifying the seas, you were patrolling the waters when a storm shipwrecked your boat \u2013 and you find yourself a castaway on the shores of Ryukyu Island, the only survivor of your unit. With your sword by your side, you walk into the depths of the Island, set on uncovering and dismantling the clandestine plots of the Japanese pirates. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Ink and wash painting world </strong> <br>The game's art is inspired by traditional Chinese ink and wash paintings. From the humblest blade of grass to the most majestic mountains of Fuling Island, each scene is beautifully painted in ink and wash. Its artistic design also draws inspiration from ancient Chinese paintings' character styles and proportions, providing players with a captivating visual experience. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Tactical melee with cold weapons </strong> <br><i>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty</i> will put your reflexes and warrior senses to the test. Its combat system is built upon three basic attack actions: stab, cleave, and sweep, which form the basis of both offense and defense. While executing these moves, it is crucial to discern the enemy's attacks simultaneously. You can deflect their attacks by accurately anticipating the enemy's actions. Stay calm in the midst of the storm while you ponder the enemy's every move, and you will remain undefeated in battle. <br><br>The game offers a variety of combat styles, ranging from close-quarters melee weapons to long-range bows and arrows. You can either block enemy attacks with your weapons or utilize evading maneuvers and counterattacks. The key to overcoming adversaries lies in swiftly switching between offense and defense, adeptly countering their moves. Only by mastering the art of adaptation and switching styles you will ultimately triumph over your foes. <br><strong class=\"hmb\"><br>Historical weaponry and armor </strong> <br>The game offers a variety of weapons and equipment for players to choose from. Each piece of weaponry is meticulously recreated to reflect its origins in real historical contexts. <br><br>You can also disarm enemies and utilize their weapon skills against them. Through diligent practice, mastering the techniques of your adversaries, and then applying them to your own weaponry, you will become even more formidable in combat. <br><br><span> </span>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Circuit_Art"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "dwarvenrealms": {"human_name": "Dwarven Realms", "machine_name": "dwarvenrealms", "youtube_link": "yadCNLul3MM", "callout": "82% Positive on Steam<br><br>Lead a party of heroes on a quest to reclaim ancient dwarven kingdoms swallowed by darkness.

Are you brave enough to face them?&nbsp;<strong>Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.</strong><br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Explore a procedurally generated world</strong>&nbsp;that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Players unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food!&nbsp;<strong>Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats.</strong>&nbsp;Don't fight on an empty stomach!<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Ghostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero.</strong>&nbsp;The 6 classes are:<br></span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li><strong>The Adept:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.</li>\n<li><strong>The Exorcist:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.</li>\n<li><strong>The Feral:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.</li>\n<li><strong>The Geomancer:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.</li>\n<li><strong>The Hashashin:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.</li>\n<li><strong>The Sentinel:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>BUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM</strong><br><span>Each class comes with a \u201cskill set\u201d, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong>Skill modifiers</strong>&nbsp;can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs. For example:<br></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>Some skill modifiers are&nbsp;<strong>trigger modifiers</strong>. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier\u2019s specified conditions are met. Examples:<br></span><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><strong><br>COMBO SKILLS</strong><br></span><span>Each active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills.</span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">The Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.<br></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><i>The glyphs are based on the Toki Pona language, designed by Sonja Lang.</i><br></span><br><span>Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.</span><br><br><span>Here's where things get interesting:&nbsp;</span><strong>Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration.</strong><span>&nbsp;Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:</span><br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\">\n<li>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kris</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Keris</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>- a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.</li>\n<li>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Bow and Arrow</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!</li>\n<li><strong>Parangs</strong>, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.</li>\n<li>The deadly<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kukri</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.</li>\n<li>The trusty<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Spear</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.</li>\n<li>Finally, there are enchanted<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Talismans</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><span>In addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.</span><br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\">Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:<br></span><br><strong>Spirits</strong><span>&nbsp;inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the&nbsp;</span><strong>Psychic</strong><span>&nbsp;to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.</span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><br>In Southeast Asian folklore, the&nbsp;<strong>Orang Bunian</strong>&nbsp;are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels.

As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>", "user_ratings": {"steam_percent|decimal": 0.82, "display_user_ratings": "steam_overall", "review_text": "Very Positive", "steam_count": 12337}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Fatshark", "developer-url": "http://www.fatsharkgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "warhammer40000_battlesector": {"human_name": "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector", "machine_name": "warhammer40000_battlesector", "youtube_link": "nVsCATpZloc", "callout": "<p>82% Positive on Steam</p>", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 12.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<i>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</i> is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millenium.
