Our programs have earned support from the CEOs of top Fortune 500 companies, engaged 700+ industry professionals, delivered among the most robust dataset on computer science education, and been featured in 100+ publications, from <i>The New York Times</i> to the <i>Today Show</i>. Our alumnae are overwhelmingly choosing to major in computer science or related studies and consistently name Girls Who Code's programs as their chief incentive to do so.<br /><br />Girls Who Code is dedicated to closing the gender gap in the technology world.

You might turn up your nose at first, but once the seven-sided-dice start rolling you find yourself sucked in.\u201d</p><p>Here are some other reviews:</p><p>\t- Year of the Dungeon: \u201cGoodman took a very old-school point of view and made a game that manages to offer a fresh perspective on many aspects of the game while loving maintaining all the core tenets of old school play. More importantly, the game doesn\u2019t just provide rules, but it\u2019s a primer on how to get the most out of its chosen style of play.\u201d</p><p>\t- Game Knight Reviews: \u201cThe DCC RPG book has a suggested retail price of $39.95, which I think is quite reasonable in an age when smaller hardcover books are going for the same general price point. But when you think about all the art in the book, $40 is a steal. And that\u2019s part of my point about it being distracting. I turn the page and get lost in the art, some of which is amazingly detailed and then I have to reread the page prior to remember what I was reading about.\u201d</p><p>\t- Raven Crowking's Nest: \u201cHaving read the Dungeon Crawl Classics core rulebook rather exhaustively now, I am coming to the conclusion that this will be my go-to game for all time.\u201d</p><p>\t- EN World: \u201cMake no mistake, DCC RPG is not for everyone and it does not try to be. Randomization, heavy use of tables, critical fumbles, and no multiclassing are strong departures from what many new gamers have become accustomed to.\u201d</p><p>Written by: Joseph Goodman, Harley Stroh, Michael Curtis, Brendan LaSalle, et. al.</p><p>Art by: Doug Kovacs, Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, Brad McDevitt, Russ Nicholson, Sanjulian, Jeff Easley, Erol Otus, et. al.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Lankhmar", "developer-url": "https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-role-playing-game-pdf/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "dcclankhmar_issue4_violenceforvotishal": {"human_name": "DCC Lankhmar #4: Violence for Votishal", "machine_name": "dcclankhmar_issue4_violenceforvotishal", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 8.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>A level 4 adventure set in Lankhmar!</p><p>Votishal the Silent is on the rise!

It's not all cuddles and snoot boops though: running a shelter can be a lot of work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their chances of finding the right forever homes. <br><br>Each day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more dogs. <br><br>Some dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day. <br><strong><br>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Support real-world charity. </strong> 20% of the developer's profit from sales of <i> To The Rescue! </i> goes towards real dog shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong> Every dog is unique. </strong> Each dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them distinctive and memorable.</li>\n<li><strong> Match dogs with adopters' needs. </strong> Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.</li>\n<li><strong> Upgrade and customize your shelter. </strong> If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more!</li>\n<li><strong> Keep the shelter open. </strong> Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter. You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can keep helping dogs find homes.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs! <br><strong><br>Take Care of Dogs</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Every dog is unique - Each dog is generated with its own traits, food preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.</li>\n<li>Fulfill their needs - Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy. It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes.</li>\n<li>Minigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O\u2019 War, Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Manage the Shelter</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Balance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses.</li>\n<li>Each day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to be made.</li>\n<li>Grow and Upgrade - Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows!</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Make a Difference</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Event-driven story - In <i>To The Rescue!</i>'s main story mode you can progress from housing dogs in your own garage to running a giant, efficient shelter of your own. There will always be events that keep you on your toes, and story threads that develop between them.</li>\n<li>Fostering and Adopting - The most important part of running a shelter is helping animals find homes. Match dogs' traits with the preferences of visitors to maximize their chances of finding homes. Find fosters who can take care of dogs when you don't have room.</li>\n<li>In-Game Community Impact - It's not just the shelter activities that you have to manage; you also must establish the shelter as part of the community. Host events, promote, educate, and make sure that you stay in a positive light.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Tough Decisions</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>From the very beginning of the project, we wanted to teach about the real world problems shelters face. The truth of the matter is that there are way more dogs and cats in need than shelters can handle. It can be hard for \u201cno-kill\u201d shelters to take in every animal that might need help.</li>\n<li>There are dogs that may be hard to adopt, rehabilitate, or find room for. No one ever wants to have to euthanize, but since we want to raise awareness, we don\u2019t want to pretend that it\u2019s not potentially part of the job. It\u2019s not glorified or presented as an easy way out, but it\u2019s an important part of the experience.</li>\n<li>That being said, we do include the ability to opt out of engaging with the euthanasia mechanic, for players who would rather experience the game without it.</li>\n</ul>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Little Rock Games", "developer-url": "https://www.littlerockgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "onemoreisland": {"human_name": "One More Island", "machine_name": "onemoreisland", "youtube_link": "bfATVU7SH0Y", "callout": "The Queen of the Old World calls upon you to be a capable governor and guide her latest colonies to prosperity in the Caribbean.

Lost in the Bermuda Void, a strange realm where the ocean is endless and islands fade in and out of existence, seemingly suspended in the time of Dread Pirates. Neither alive nor truly dead, they roam these waters in search of prey.

Even loaded with food, tools, and weapons, every ship can fit down into a bottle - from the tiniest schooner to the greatest dreadnaughts - and be unleashed at a moment's notice! Store away your ship for exploration or keep it as an unwelcome surprise for your enemies. Or even better, craft a custom fleet with a ship for every occasion. Lure in pirates expecting an easy fight, then surprise them with a full broadside from a man-o-war that appears out of nowhere!<br><br><strong>MAKE LANDFALL, WITH CAUTION</strong><br><br>No ship is complete without a port of call. Land on an island, use the robust crafting and building system to erect a dock worthy of your vessel, then head inland, seeking lost treasures, rare resources, and piecing together the mystery of the Bermuda Void.

The Dread Pirates are ancient sailors worth their salt, and the treasures are well hidden. First, you\u2019ll need to assemble an ancient map, torn apart by time and scattered to the four winds. Second, you\u2019ll need to find the spot and brave the dangers of whatever island or sunken ruin it guides you to. Only then can you claim the treasure for yourself and carve out your destiny on the high seas.</p>\n<p><strong> BATTLE THE PIRATES AND THE SEAS</strong><br><br>An intuitive dual-wielding system means fast-paced battles on land and deck. However, the true challenge lies on the high seas, as sail ships clash. Watch your speed, heading, and enemy positions. A mistake might mean that your broadside will fall short and the enemy will turn your prized ship into a mess of splinters and torn sails - just as an oceanic anomaly bears down on your both, with storms, whirlpools, and strange beasts for whom a survivor is a rare delicacy...</p>\n<p><strong> CAN YOU SOLVE THE MYSTERY?</strong><br><br>Between unpredictable anomalies, vicious pirates, and the ever-looming specter of hunger and dehydration, lies the mystery of the void. Where did this anomaly come from? Why does it persist? When will you be able to escape? Can you escape? The answers wait within the storms, in sunken pyramids, amidst wreckage beneath the waves.

Pursued by a notorious cut-throat Pirate Hunter and a creepy French Physician who believes that Guybrush's eerily-infected hand holds the secret of eternal life, Threepwood sails the seven seas in search of La Esponja Grande, a legendary sea sponge with unparalleled voodoo exfoliating abilities. But little does Guybrush know, his quest is part of a larger, more sinister plot, and good and evil are not always as they seem... <br>Who can Guybrush trust? Where can he turn? Everything you think you know will be challenged as Tales of Monkey Island builds to its unexpected finale! <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter One </strong> <br><br>The saga begins with a heated battle involving the brave but often bumbling Mighty Pirate\u2122 Guybrush, his beloved wife Elaine, and their nemesis, the demon pirate LeChuck. When the showdown goes up in flames, Guybrush finds himself marooned on a strange island with winds that always blow inward. How will our hero manage to escape this meteorological anomaly? What has become of LeChuck and Elaine? And what's the story with the infectious voodoo pox that's spreading across the Caribbean, causing Guybrush and other pirates to act like unruly hooligans? These are just some of the many questions posed in this first chapter of one of the most rollicking and rip-roaring entertainment experiences this summer. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Two </strong> <br><br>Guybrush's adventures continue on the high seas as pox-plagued pirates lay siege to the innocent Mer-People. In between defending the Mer-People and dodging the persistent pirate hunter hot on his trail, Guybrush manages to catch up to his beloved wife and despised arch-nemesis \u2014 but their reunion is short-lived. Now Guybrush must focus on eradicating the Pox of LeChuck before more harm can be done. And as the Mighty Pirate draws closer to a cure, the waters will only grow murkier in this thrilling chapter of the epic saga. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Three </strong> <br><br>In the third Tales of Monkey Island chapter, Guybrush gets in deep (literally!) as his quest for the voodoo exfoliating La Esponja Grande takes a scenic twist -- through the guts of a giant manatee! <br>Trapped in the belly of the beast, our hero encounters a surprising band of castaways, including the long-lost (and obsessive-compulsive) explorer Coronado De Cava. Can the Mighty Pirate win the suspicious De Cava's trust? Will sexy pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay prove to be a ruthless enemy, or an unlikely ally? Will the group find La Esponja Grande in time to save Elaine from the rampant Pox of LeChuck? And will the world be crushed by the gnashing teeth of a certain demonic skull? Tales of Monkey Island's moist and absorbing third episode, Lair of the Leviathan, will answer some of these urgent questions -- and raise still more -- as the five month adventure builds to its epic climax! <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Four </strong> <br><br>Guybrush returns to Flotsam Island, but forget about a hero's welcome. Handed over to De Singe by the backstabbing Morgan LeFlay, Guybrush is seized by an angry mob and put on trial! With a silk-tongued prosecutor in his face and a hangman's noose dangling over his neck, Guybrush must figure out how to defend himself against grave accusations. Meanwhile, the determined Marquis sets his sights on a new and far more attractive test subject. How on earth will the Mighty Pirate get out of this mess? The monthly Tales of Monkey Island tension continues to mount in \"The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood.\" Brace yourself for a shocking revelation that will rock the world of Monkey Island to its core. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Five </strong> <br><br>Our piratey heroes meet their ultimate match with the Rise of the Pirate God.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
