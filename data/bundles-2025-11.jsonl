He then identifies different types of people\u2014archetypes\u2014and the ways we fu*k ourselves over, teaching us how to recover from self-limiting patterns, such as:</p><p>Never being able to save money or set realistic financial goals</p><p>Landing in the same type of toxic relationships with an inability to set boundaries</p><p>Constantly worrying about what we can\u2019t control or how others may view\u2014and judge\u2014us</p><p>Communicating with insecurity and self-doubt, instead of confidence and conviction</p><p>Analyzing why we act the way we do, including what our common grenades are that blow up our lives, Bishop then shows how we can interrupt the cycle and stop self-sabotaging our lives. When we can stop negative thoughts and behaviors before they even start, we can achieve the unthinkable and start to find success in the areas we thought we never could.</p><p>Look, you might have fu*ked up in the past, so what? Stop Doing That Sh*t reveals how you can live the life you always knew you wanted but could never quite seem to have. As Bishop says, \u201cThe future has arrived. Now what the hell are you going to do about it?\u201d Well, your future starts today.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Bishop, Gary John", "developer-url": "https://garyjohnbishop.com/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "whokilledchange": {"human_name": "Who Killed Change?", "machine_name": "whokilledchange", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "HarperCollins", "publisher-url": "https://www.harpercollins.com/products/who-killed-change-ken-blanchard?variant=42921288007714"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 10.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Who Killed Change?</p><p>Solving the Mystery of Leading People Through Change</p><p>Every day organizations around the world launch change initiatives\u2014often big, expensive ones\u2014designed to improve the status quo.

Pirsig, 1962</p><p>More than a decade before the release of the book that would make him famous, Robert M. Pirsig had already caught hold of the central theme that would animate Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: \u201cQuality,\u201d a concept loosely likened to \u201cexcellence,\u201d \u201crightness,\u201d or \u201cfitness\u201d that Pirsig saw as kindred to the Buddhist ideas of \u201cdharma\u201d or the \u201cTao.\u201d As he later wrote in Zen, \u201cQuality is the Buddha.\u201d</p><p>Though he was revered by fans who considered him a guru, the famously private Pirsig published only two books and consented to few interviews and almost no public appearances in later decades. Yet he wrote and thought almost continually, refining his \u201cMetaphysics of Quality\u201d until his death in 2017.</p><p>Now, for the first time, readers will be granted access to five decades of Pirsig\u2019s personal writings in this posthumous collection that illuminates the evolution of his thinking to an unprecedented degree. Skillfully edited and introduced by Wendy K. Pirsig, Robert\u2019s wife of four decades, the collection includes previously unpublished texts, speeches, letters, interviews, and private notes, as well as key excerpts from Zen and the Art of the Motorcycle Maintenance and his second book, Lila.</p><p>Since its publication in 1974, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has established itself as a modern classic of popular philosophy; selling millions of copies and inspiring a generation, while serving as a perennial touchstone for the generations that follow.

The first type drains intelligence, energy, and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people\u2019s heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders are expected to do more with less.</p><p>In this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explores these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations\u2014getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation.</p><p>In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman has identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers.

Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager.

Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked\u2014the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn\u2019t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it\u2019s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn\u2019t\u2014and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the \u201csubtle art\u201d of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.</p><p>In Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom\u2014and even of hope itself.</p><p>With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven\u2019t considered before. It\u2019s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Manson, Mark", "developer-url": "https://markmanson.net/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"roomtoread": {"machine_name": "roomtoread", "youtube_link": null, "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><em>Donations to support Room to Read are made to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPal Giving Fund</a>, subject to its policies.<br></em><br>We envision a world in which all children can pursue a quality education that enables them to reach their full potential and contribute to their communities and the world.</p>\n<p>Room to Read seeks to transform the lives of millions of children in low-income communities by focusing on literacy and gender equality in education.

No Events are random, you know exactly where you're stepping with each path taken. </strong> <br><br>You'll build your deck as you go, <strong> a CCG experience where you can always modify your deck </strong> . Swapping in and out cards before certain encounters will always help improve your odds and allows you to adapt to monster strategies. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Purging</strong><br>Combat is always fast paced! You can use your own cards as energy, allowing you to choose which cards from your hand to discard to gain additional energy and fuel high powered combos. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Customise your Cards</strong><br>Collect Void Stones, powerful Runes that can be socketed into cards to grant them additional abilities! Choosing where to place your Void Stones is all a part of your ever adapting strategy. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Features </strong> <br>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 380 player cards, each with unique upgrades</li>\n<li>4 Classes - each with 2 of their own starting decks and unique spells</li>\n<li>Unlockable cards and custom Deck Backs.</li>\n<li>Player Spells and abilities - adding another element to the card play strategy</li>\n<li>Over 90+ unique and handcrafted Monsters</li>\n<li>6 different Void Stones to infuse with your cards, giving each card up to 14 variations when coupled with upgrades</li>\n<li>Over 250+ Artifacts</li>\n</ul>\n<strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Your deck - your way. </strong> <br><i>Vault of the Void</i> is not a <strong> traditional </strong> Deck Builder.

Quickly switching out Bleed cards in favour of Rage gain could be the difference between victory, or an agonising defeat. <br><br>The more you play, the more you\u2019ll learn about each mob group, and which deck type would be best suited to handle the challenge ahead. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Customise your Cards </strong> <br>One of the most unique features in <i>Vault of the Void</i> is the ability to customise your cards. You\u2019ll gather Void Stones as you progress through a run, and have the ability to socket them into any card in your library, giving them extra abilities. <br><br>Take the humble Master Slash for example, which will deal 5 damage. Taking a Yellow Void Stone will now also grant you 4 Block. Or maybe a Blue Void Stone, which now gives it the added ability of \"Draw a Card. Discard a Card.\". There's hundreds of variations to try out, and how each of these interact with each other is part of the fun (and learning) that comes as you play. <br><br>But that's not all! The variations continue, as all cards have the ability to evolve into more dynamic and powerful versions! Each card has a unique upgrade (which aren't always just number boosts!), plus the ability to add a Void Stone. Turn any humble card into potent backbones of your strategy. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Fast paced combat </strong> <br><i>Vault of the Void</i> offers card fights that are fast paced and familiar, with some subtle unique changes. <br><br>Although you\u2019ll regain some energy at the start of each turn, Purging cards gives you the final decision on which cards you should play, and which you should sacrifice to setup for later turns. To Purge a card, right click it, sending it to your Discard and gain 1 Energy! <br><br>As creatures attack during their turn, they\u2019ll increase your Threat. At the end of your next turn, your Threat stack will trigger, dealing damage to your hit points equal to its total value. Play Block cards to reduce your Threat reactively, and make the hard choice between damage, or survival. <br><br>The way Threat works takes a huge mental burden off the player. You'll no longer need to do math to figure out how much to Block for.

You might turn up your nose at first, but once the seven-sided-dice start rolling you find yourself sucked in.\u201d</p><p>Here are some other reviews:</p><p>\t- Year of the Dungeon: \u201cGoodman took a very old-school point of view and made a game that manages to offer a fresh perspective on many aspects of the game while loving maintaining all the core tenets of old school play. More importantly, the game doesn\u2019t just provide rules, but it\u2019s a primer on how to get the most out of its chosen style of play.\u201d</p><p>\t- Game Knight Reviews: \u201cThe DCC RPG book has a suggested retail price of $39.95, which I think is quite reasonable in an age when smaller hardcover books are going for the same general price point. But when you think about all the art in the book, $40 is a steal. And that\u2019s part of my point about it being distracting. I turn the page and get lost in the art, some of which is amazingly detailed and then I have to reread the page prior to remember what I was reading about.\u201d</p><p>\t- Raven Crowking's Nest: \u201cHaving read the Dungeon Crawl Classics core rulebook rather exhaustively now, I am coming to the conclusion that this will be my go-to game for all time.\u201d</p><p>\t- EN World: \u201cMake no mistake, DCC RPG is not for everyone and it does not try to be. Randomization, heavy use of tables, critical fumbles, and no multiclassing are strong departures from what many new gamers have become accustomed to.\u201d</p><p>Written by: Joseph Goodman, Harley Stroh, Michael Curtis, Brendan LaSalle, et. al.</p><p>Art by: Doug Kovacs, Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, Brad McDevitt, Russ Nicholson, Sanjulian, Jeff Easley, Erol Otus, et. al.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Lankhmar", "developer-url": "https://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-role-playing-game-pdf/"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "dcclankhmar_issue4_violenceforvotishal": {"human_name": "DCC Lankhmar #4: Violence for Votishal", "machine_name": "dcclankhmar_issue4_violenceforvotishal", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 8.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>A level 4 adventure set in Lankhmar!</p><p>Votishal the Silent is on the rise!

It's not all cuddles and snoot boops though: running a shelter can be a lot of work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their chances of finding the right forever homes. <br><br>Each day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more dogs. <br><br>Some dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day. <br><strong><br>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Support real-world charity. </strong> 20% of the developer's profit from sales of <i> To The Rescue! </i> goes towards real dog shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong> Every dog is unique. </strong> Each dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them distinctive and memorable.</li>\n<li><strong> Match dogs with adopters' needs. </strong> Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.</li>\n<li><strong> Upgrade and customize your shelter. </strong> If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more!</li>\n<li><strong> Keep the shelter open. </strong> Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter. You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can keep helping dogs find homes.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs! <br><strong><br>Take Care of Dogs</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Every dog is unique - Each dog is generated with its own traits, food preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.</li>\n<li>Fulfill their needs - Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy. It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes.</li>\n<li>Minigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O\u2019 War, Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Manage the Shelter</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Balance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses.</li>\n<li>Each day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to be made.</li>\n<li>Grow and Upgrade - Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows!</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Make a Difference</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Event-driven story - In <i>To The Rescue!</i>'s main story mode you can progress from housing dogs in your own garage to running a giant, efficient shelter of your own. There will always be events that keep you on your toes, and story threads that develop between them.</li>\n<li>Fostering and Adopting - The most important part of running a shelter is helping animals find homes. Match dogs' traits with the preferences of visitors to maximize their chances of finding homes. Find fosters who can take care of dogs when you don't have room.</li>\n<li>In-Game Community Impact - It's not just the shelter activities that you have to manage; you also must establish the shelter as part of the community. Host events, promote, educate, and make sure that you stay in a positive light.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><strong>Tough Decisions</strong><br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>From the very beginning of the project, we wanted to teach about the real world problems shelters face. The truth of the matter is that there are way more dogs and cats in need than shelters can handle. It can be hard for \u201cno-kill\u201d shelters to take in every animal that might need help.</li>\n<li>There are dogs that may be hard to adopt, rehabilitate, or find room for. No one ever wants to have to euthanize, but since we want to raise awareness, we don\u2019t want to pretend that it\u2019s not potentially part of the job. It\u2019s not glorified or presented as an easy way out, but it\u2019s an important part of the experience.</li>\n<li>That being said, we do include the ability to opt out of engaging with the euthanasia mechanic, for players who would rather experience the game without it.</li>\n</ul>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Little Rock Games", "developer-url": "https://www.littlerockgames.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "onemoreisland": {"human_name": "One More Island", "machine_name": "onemoreisland", "youtube_link": "bfATVU7SH0Y", "callout": "The Queen of the Old World calls upon you to be a capable governor and guide her latest colonies to prosperity in the Caribbean.

Lost in the Bermuda Void, a strange realm where the ocean is endless and islands fade in and out of existence, seemingly suspended in the time of Dread Pirates. Neither alive nor truly dead, they roam these waters in search of prey. Unless you want to be fodder left in the wake of their mighty ships, you'll have to craft a ship and take to the waves - then conquer the <i>forgotten seas</i>, whose treacherous waters are full of bounty, treasure, and grave danger!<br><br><strong>CRAFT SHIPS IN BOTTLES</strong><br><br>Ships are magic in the Void and essential to survival. Even loaded with food, tools, and weapons, every ship can fit down into a bottle - from the tiniest schooner to the greatest dreadnaughts - and be unleashed at a moment's notice! Store away your ship for exploration or keep it as an unwelcome surprise for your enemies. Or even better, craft a custom fleet with a ship for every occasion. Lure in pirates expecting an easy fight, then surprise them with a full broadside from a man-o-war that appears out of nowhere!<br><br><strong>MAKE LANDFALL, WITH CAUTION</strong><br><br>No ship is complete without a port of call. Land on an island, use the robust crafting and building system to erect a dock worthy of your vessel, then head inland, seeking lost treasures, rare resources, and piecing together the mystery of the Bermuda Void. But be careful: The treacherous <i>forgotten seas</i> can claim the island, just as you reach your prize, leaving you in a heart-pounding race against time to reach the shore and deploy your ship to find safety.</p>\n<p><strong> UNEARTH ANCIENT TREASURES</strong><br><br>Don\u2019t think the prizes will jump in your lap! The Dread Pirates are ancient sailors worth their salt, and the treasures are well hidden. First, you\u2019ll need to assemble an ancient map, torn apart by time and scattered to the four winds. Second, you\u2019ll need to find the spot and brave the dangers of whatever island or sunken ruin it guides you to. Only then can you claim the treasure for yourself and carve out your destiny on the high seas.</p>\n<p><strong> BATTLE THE PIRATES AND THE SEAS</strong><br><br>An intuitive dual-wielding system means fast-paced battles on land and deck. However, the true challenge lies on the high seas, as sail ships clash. Watch your speed, heading, and enemy positions. A mistake might mean that your broadside will fall short and the enemy will turn your prized ship into a mess of splinters and torn sails - just as an oceanic anomaly bears down on your both, with storms, whirlpools, and strange beasts for whom a survivor is a rare delicacy...</p>\n<p><strong> CAN YOU SOLVE THE MYSTERY?</strong><br><br>Between unpredictable anomalies, vicious pirates, and the ever-looming specter of hunger and dehydration, lies the mystery of the void. Where did this anomaly come from? Why does it persist? When will you be able to escape? Can you escape? The answers wait within the storms, in sunken pyramids, amidst wreckage beneath the waves. Build, farm, craft, sail, conquer - then face the ultimate challenge, taking your ship into the unknown and maybe, just maybe, finding a way back to the real world...</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Pangea Game Studios", "developer-url": "https://www.forgottenseas.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "echoesoftheplumgrove": {"human_name": "Echoes of the Plum Grove", "machine_name": "echoesoftheplumgrove", "youtube_link": "diPJ29Bc6ks", "callout": "A cozy farm and life simulator where after washing onto the shores of the island of Honeywood, you start a new life building a farm.

Pursued by a notorious cut-throat Pirate Hunter and a creepy French Physician who believes that Guybrush's eerily-infected hand holds the secret of eternal life, Threepwood sails the seven seas in search of La Esponja Grande, a legendary sea sponge with unparalleled voodoo exfoliating abilities. But little does Guybrush know, his quest is part of a larger, more sinister plot, and good and evil are not always as they seem... <br>Who can Guybrush trust? Where can he turn? Everything you think you know will be challenged as Tales of Monkey Island builds to its unexpected finale! <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter One </strong> <br><br>The saga begins with a heated battle involving the brave but often bumbling Mighty Pirate\u2122 Guybrush, his beloved wife Elaine, and their nemesis, the demon pirate LeChuck. When the showdown goes up in flames, Guybrush finds himself marooned on a strange island with winds that always blow inward. How will our hero manage to escape this meteorological anomaly? What has become of LeChuck and Elaine? And what's the story with the infectious voodoo pox that's spreading across the Caribbean, causing Guybrush and other pirates to act like unruly hooligans? These are just some of the many questions posed in this first chapter of one of the most rollicking and rip-roaring entertainment experiences this summer. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Two </strong> <br><br>Guybrush's adventures continue on the high seas as pox-plagued pirates lay siege to the innocent Mer-People. In between defending the Mer-People and dodging the persistent pirate hunter hot on his trail, Guybrush manages to catch up to his beloved wife and despised arch-nemesis \u2014 but their reunion is short-lived. Now Guybrush must focus on eradicating the Pox of LeChuck before more harm can be done. And as the Mighty Pirate draws closer to a cure, the waters will only grow murkier in this thrilling chapter of the epic saga. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Three </strong> <br><br>In the third Tales of Monkey Island chapter, Guybrush gets in deep (literally!) as his quest for the voodoo exfoliating La Esponja Grande takes a scenic twist -- through the guts of a giant manatee! <br>Trapped in the belly of the beast, our hero encounters a surprising band of castaways, including the long-lost (and obsessive-compulsive) explorer Coronado De Cava. Can the Mighty Pirate win the suspicious De Cava's trust? Will sexy pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay prove to be a ruthless enemy, or an unlikely ally? Will the group find La Esponja Grande in time to save Elaine from the rampant Pox of LeChuck? And will the world be crushed by the gnashing teeth of a certain demonic skull? Tales of Monkey Island's moist and absorbing third episode, Lair of the Leviathan, will answer some of these urgent questions -- and raise still more -- as the five month adventure builds to its epic climax! <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Four </strong> <br><br>Guybrush returns to Flotsam Island, but forget about a hero's welcome. Handed over to De Singe by the backstabbing Morgan LeFlay, Guybrush is seized by an angry mob and put on trial! With a silk-tongued prosecutor in his face and a hangman's noose dangling over his neck, Guybrush must figure out how to defend himself against grave accusations. Meanwhile, the determined Marquis sets his sights on a new and far more attractive test subject. How on earth will the Mighty Pirate get out of this mess? The monthly Tales of Monkey Island tension continues to mount in \"The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood.\" Brace yourself for a shocking revelation that will rock the world of Monkey Island to its core. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>About Chapter Five </strong> <br><br>Our piratey heroes meet their ultimate match with the Rise of the Pirate God.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
