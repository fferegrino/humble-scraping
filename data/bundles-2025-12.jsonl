Wind, the sole restless sentinel, howled through shattered windowpanes, weaving sorrowful moans among the hollow houses. A silhouette, cloaked in the hush of the night, stepped across the overgrown threshold, boots kicking up whispers of dust where forgotten laughter once danced. Each creak of a floorboard, each rustle of unseen leaves, was a whispered dare thrown at the face of the unknown. In this village, where moonlight carved shadows into phantoms, a dance of courage and curiosity was about to unfold, etched not on moonlit stone but on the canvas of a heart unafraid to defy the whispers of the wind.</p><p>Creative Direction by Leartes Team, Environment made by talented Artist \u201cLucas Henrique\u201d </p><p>Technical Details</p><p>Features:</p><p>294 Unique Meshes</p><p>Attention to Detail / AAA Quality</p><p>Controllable parameters in Material Instances</p><p>High-Quality Assets</p><p>Game ready/Optimized</p><p>Unique Concepts of Assets</p><p>High Attention to Details</p><p>Material Variations For Some Assets</p><p>Texture Sizes:</p><p>4096</p><p>2048</p><p>1024</p><p>Texture Size: 4096 for detailed Assets, 2048 for Mid sized Assets, &amp; 1024 for small assets</p><p>Collision: Yes, Custom collisions for complex assets</p><p>LODs: Yes, 4 LODs for complex assets</p><p>Number of Meshes: 294 Unique Meshes</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 108</p><p>Number of Textures: 209</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: All Platforms</p><p>Supported Development Versions: Unreal Engine 5.3</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Leartes Studios", "developer-url": "https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/products/the-aftermath"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "policecharacterandnpc": {"human_name": "Police Character / NPC", "machine_name": "policecharacterandnpc", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "MSRP: $20", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Police Character / NPC / High Quality / Fully Rigged / Ready for Mannequin Animations.</p><p>The Character is made according to Unreal Engine Mannequin Skeleton and all ready animations will work with it.</p><p>Technical Details</p><p>Features:</p><p>Rigged</p><p>Good to use in Games / Virtual Productions</p><p>Customizable Clothes</p><p>Game ready/Optimized</p><p>Fully Customizable / Material Variations</p><p>Texture Sizes:</p><p> 4096 / 2048</p><p>Collision: Yes, automatically generated</p><p>Number of Meshes: 12</p><p>Number of Blueprints: 5</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 18</p><p>Number of Textures: 58</p><p>Supported Unreal Engine Versions: 4.22 , 4.23 , 4.24 , 4.25 , 4.26 , 4.27+ , UE5</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Leartes Studios"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "stylizedpiratetavernmodularpiratepiratetavernstylised": {"human_name": "Stylized Pirate Tavern (Modular) ( Pirate , Pirate , Tavern , Stylised )", "machine_name": "stylizedpiratetavernmodularpiratepiratetavernstylised", "youtube_link": "XZ4ihaofVu8", "callout": "MSRP: $80", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Leartes Studios", "publisher-url": "https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>HERE, YOU CAN CHECK OUR NEW ASSET PLATFORM AND GRAB SOME FREE ENVIRONMENT PACKS</p><p>https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/</p><p>Stylized Pirate Tavern</p><p>This is a high-quality, modular asset pack that includes a wide variety of easy-to-assemble modular building assets and high-quality props.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
