Finally, you\u2019ll wade into advanced techniques, like hacking mobile apps, testing APIs, and reviewing source code for vulnerabilities.\r</p><p>Along the way, you\u2019ll learn how to:\r</p><p>- Identify and successfully exploit a wide array of common web vulnerabilities\r</p><p>- Set up a hacking environment, configure Burp Suite, and use its modules to intercept traffic and hunt for bugs\r</p><p>- Chain together multiple bugs for maximum impact and higher payouts\r</p><p>- Bypass protection mechanisms like input sanitization and blocklists to make your attacks succeed\r</p><p>- Automate tedious bug-hunting tasks with fuzzing and bash scripting\r</p><p>- Set up an Android app testing environment\r</p><p>Thousands of data breaches happen every year. By understanding vulnerabilities and how they happen, you can help prevent malicious attacks, protect apps and users, and make the internet a safer place.
