And it\u2019s not our fault. We\u2019ve been good and caring leaders, we\u2019ve led people in empowering, engaging ways to create meaningful, productive work. But now we face external conditions far beyond our control to change, dynamics intensifying at shocking speed.</p><p>The perfect storm is here, created by the coalescence of climate and human-created catastrophes. As leaders dedicated to serving the causes and people we treasure, confronted by this unrelenting tsunami, what are we to do? I state my answer to this also with full confidence:</p><p>We need to restore sanity by awakening the human spirit. We can achieve this only if we undertake the most challenging and meaningful work of our leader lives: Creating Islands of Sanity.</p><p>An Island of Sanity is a gift of possibility and refuge created by people\u2019s commitment to form healthy community to do meaningful work. It requires sane leaders with unshakable faith in people\u2019s innate generosity, creativity, and kindness. It sets itself apart as an island to protect itself from the life-destroying dynamics, policies, and behaviors that oppress and deny the human spirit. No matter what is happening around us, we can discover practices that enliven our human spirits and produce meaningful contributions for this time.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Maja Djikic"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "journalofradicalpermission_adailyguidetofollowingyoursoulscalling": {"human_name": "Journal of Radical Permission: A Daily \nGuide to Following Your Soul's Calling", "machine_name": "journalofradicalpermission_adailyguidetofollowingyoursoulscalling", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Berret-Koehler", "publisher-url": "https://bkconnection.com/products/9781523002429_journal-of-radical-permission"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 1.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Bestselling authors adrienne maree brown and Sonya Renee Taylor create an unforgettable and transformational experience of journaling your way into your most authentic self.</p><p>This journal will help you claim permission to live your purpose.

Reflecting as he walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and spent time in the deserts of Morocco and in the Andes of Peru, he saw that specific mental activities and attitudes take our happiness from us. He calls them the five thieves of happiness: the thief of control, the thief of conceit, the thief of coveting, the thief of consumption, and the thief of comfort.

Unique yet familiar dice roll inspired movement, encounter and combat mechanics add even more spontaneity and variety as your fortunes rise and fall on the roll of the dice. <br><br><br><strong>DIGESTIBLE ROGUELITE CAMPAIGN</strong><br><br><i>For The King II</i> provides a complete campaign with over 30 hours of gameplay, split into 5 separate adventures, each narratively linked. The journey is long and the path is treacherous but fear not, if your party fails you will start stronger and wiser on your next playthrough with better starting items to draft into your loadout. <br><br><br><strong>MUSTER YOUR MIGHT</strong><br><br>Create your party from 12 unique character classes, each with their own unique perks, strengths and playstyles. From the heavy-handed hitter of The Blacksmith, to the wily potion-wielding Alchemist, you choose which characters will take on the fearsome Queensguard and the combat strategies that will ensure success. Introduce new characters to your party with mercenaries and companions that enable you to pluck wild beasts from the forest floor and recruit ruthless mercenaries from local taverns (for a price of course) to bolster your ranks in times of trouble. <br><br><br><strong>PARTY OF FOUR</strong><br><br>Traverse Fahrul solo or with up-to three friends in four-player co-op. As a solo player you can control all characters in your party, giving you complete ownership of the campaign map and combat strategy whilst in four-player co-op you must coordinate and negotiate with your party members. Play online multiplayer with your friends controlling your own character(s) or play offline co-op on the same PC. Offline co-op supports multiple controllers; each controller will have input control on everyone\u2019s turn. <br><br><br><strong>EVOLVED TURN-BASED COMBAT</strong><br><br>Inspired by turn-based classics, <i>For The King II</i> adds strategic depth to much-loved combat mechanics with the new Battle Grid, where movement and position provide you and your enemies with strategic buffs and penalties. Defend the back row by equipping a mighty Tower Shield, push enemies into lethal pools of burning fire, or entangle melee troops with dark magic cast with weapons looted from vanquished foes. The choice is yours! <br><br><br><strong>EXPLORE A FANTASTICALLY REALIZED REALM</strong><br><br>Fahrul is both beautiful and deadly in equal measure.

You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.</p>\n<p>Choose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.<br><br>To stay one step ahead of your pursuers you\u2019ll need three things: A belt-worthy ship, a tight crew and a contract or two.</p>\n<p>The ship you stole. It\u2019s a ragged old Rig that\u2019s seen better days, but it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Upgrade your ship to extend its range, reach new locations and turn it from a hovel to a home.</p>\n<p>Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you\u2019ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the work that\u2019ll keep you flying. From temporary contractors to new residents of the Rig, each of these characters has their own story, skills and troubles. Choose carefully.</p>\n<p>Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt\u2019s many hubs. These high-risk jobs each have their own challenges. From exploring treacherous derelicts and risky heists, to asteroid surveying and ship repair, you\u2019ll need to make the most of your skills, crew and resources to complete the contract and get paid.<br><br>Soon after escaping from your corporate overlords, you fell under the control of a local criminal gang and its leader, Laine. Now, after a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.<br><br>Each character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability, upgradable and customisable, that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success. Each class offers different tactical possibilities.<br><br>Nothing in the Belt ever runs smooth, including your artificial body. Citizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.<br><br>Contracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.<br><br>The Starward Belt offers a bigger, more varied world than the original game. Instead of living on a single station, you'll chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.<br><br>Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices.

We seek to bring every eligible child's wish to life because a wish is an integral part of a child's treatment journey. Research shows children who have wishes granted can build the physical and emotional strength they need to fight their illness. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Make-A-Wish is the world\u2019s leading children\u2019s wish-granting organization, serving children in more than 50 countries worldwide. Together, generous donors, supporters, staff and more than 40,000 volunteers, grant a wish every 17 minutes, on average, somewhere in the world. Since 1980, Make-A-Wish has granted nearly 450,000 wishes to children; more than 30,000 last year alone.

James Serra, big data and data warehousing solution architect at Microsoft, examines common data architecture concepts, including how data warehouses have had to evolve to work with data lake features. You'll learn what data lakehouses can help you achieve, as well as how to distinguish data mesh hype from reality. Best of all, you'll be able to determine the most appropriate data architecture for your needs. With this book, you'll:</p><ul><li>\tGain a working understanding of several data architectures</li><li>\tLearn the strengths and weaknesses of each approach</li><li>\tDistinguish data architecture theory from reality</li><li>\tPick the best architecture for your use case</li><li>\tUnderstand the differences between data warehouses and data lakes</li><li>\tLearn common data architecture concepts to help you build better solutions</li><li>\tExplore the historical evolution and characteristics of data architectures</li><li>\tLearn essentials of running an architecture design session, team organization, and project success factors</li></ul><p>Free from product discussions, this book will serve as a timeless resource for years to come.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "James Serra"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "monolithtomicroservices": {"human_name": "Monolith to Microservices", "machine_name": "monolithtomicroservices", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "O'Reilly", "publisher-url": "https://www.oreilly.com"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 25.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>How do you detangle a monolithic system and migrate it to a microservice architecture?

Featuring the most popular and distinctive species ; including garden birds, exotic birds, birds of prey, water birds, flightless birds and more ; each pattern wings its way to you with step-by-step instructions and full-size templates, making them perfect for all abilities. The finished little birdies would make cute brooches, bag charms and home accessories, or can even be scaled up to make bigger plushes, all of which will make your friends into avid twitchers! Author Alison J Reid has spent months brooding away in her studio, researching all different kinds of birds, both common and rare. She has checked out their shapes, plumage and markings, and spent so much time trying to perfect their colourful, beautiful wings. It became an obsession! It was only by researching the various details that make each breed so distinctive, that Alison has been able to capture each of their unique qualities and differences. Pattern, colour and shape are key, so capturing these details in felt was important. Luckily, there are so many different colours of felt available! Felt's non-fraying, double sided, robust qualities make it easy to create all the little details that make each bird design so unique and instantly recognisable. Each bird pattern can be traced straight from the page (or enlarged if you want to sew a larger plush), and simple instructions mean that even beginners can get started. And because all the birds are sewn by hand, you don't need a sewing machine and can sit out in the garden with the birds while you sew. Whether you choose to sew just your own favourites, or make gifts for the other bird-lovers in your life, this book will provide hours of fun and inspiration.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Reid, Alison J"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "storybooktoys": {"human_name": "Storybook Toys", "machine_name": "storybooktoys", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "C&T Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Make a cherished companion for your little one Inspired by vintage patterns from the 1940s, these 16 projects include loveable dolls and softies, pillows, puppets, and even a little girl's first handbag.

Cats? But they're all the same, aren't they? Well, no not really! When you start to explore the many different breeds of cats, you realise just what a variety of breeds there is, and how different they are from each other. Author Alison J Reid has spent months beavering away in her studio, researching all different kinds of cats, both domestic and wild. She has checked out their colourings and markings, and spent so much time trying to perfect their colourful, beautiful eyes. It became an obsession! It was only by researching the various details that make each breed so distinctive, that Alison has been able to capture each of their unique qualities and differences. Pattern, colour and shape are key, so capturing these details in felt was important. Luckily, there are so many different colours of felt available, including fur-like mottled effects. Felt's non-fraying, double sided, robust qualities make it easy to create all the little details that make each cat breed so unique and instantly recognisable. She has also used small amounts of wool curls and roving to add texture for truly strokable results. Each cat pattern can be traced straight from the page (or enlarged if you want to sew a larger plush), and simple instructions mean that even beginners can get started. And because all the cats are sewn by hand, you don't need a sewing machine and can sit on the sofa with your cat while you sew. Whether you choose to sew just your own favourites, or make cats for the other crazy cat people in your life, this book will provide hours of fun and inspiration.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Reid, Alison J"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "cuddlebuddiesanimalsoftiepattern": {"human_name": "Cuddle Buddies Animal Softie Pattern", "machine_name": "cuddlebuddiesanimalsoftiepattern", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "C&T Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>5 squeezable BFFs to warm your heart Snuggable, huggable, and tons of fun to sew!

Wind, the sole restless sentinel, howled through shattered windowpanes, weaving sorrowful moans among the hollow houses. A silhouette, cloaked in the hush of the night, stepped across the overgrown threshold, boots kicking up whispers of dust where forgotten laughter once danced. Each creak of a floorboard, each rustle of unseen leaves, was a whispered dare thrown at the face of the unknown. In this village, where moonlight carved shadows into phantoms, a dance of courage and curiosity was about to unfold, etched not on moonlit stone but on the canvas of a heart unafraid to defy the whispers of the wind.</p><p>Creative Direction by Leartes Team, Environment made by talented Artist \u201cLucas Henrique\u201d </p><p>Technical Details</p><p>Features:</p><p>294 Unique Meshes</p><p>Attention to Detail / AAA Quality</p><p>Controllable parameters in Material Instances</p><p>High-Quality Assets</p><p>Game ready/Optimized</p><p>Unique Concepts of Assets</p><p>High Attention to Details</p><p>Material Variations For Some Assets</p><p>Texture Sizes:</p><p>4096</p><p>2048</p><p>1024</p><p>Texture Size: 4096 for detailed Assets, 2048 for Mid sized Assets, &amp; 1024 for small assets</p><p>Collision: Yes, Custom collisions for complex assets</p><p>LODs: Yes, 4 LODs for complex assets</p><p>Number of Meshes: 294 Unique Meshes</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 108</p><p>Number of Textures: 209</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: All Platforms</p><p>Supported Development Versions: Unreal Engine 5.3</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Leartes Studios", "developer-url": "https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/products/the-aftermath"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "policecharacterandnpc": {"human_name": "Police Character / NPC", "machine_name": "policecharacterandnpc", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "MSRP: $20", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Police Character / NPC / High Quality / Fully Rigged / Ready for Mannequin Animations.</p><p>The Character is made according to Unreal Engine Mannequin Skeleton and all ready animations will work with it.</p><p>Technical Details</p><p>Features:</p><p>Rigged</p><p>Good to use in Games / Virtual Productions</p><p>Customizable Clothes</p><p>Game ready/Optimized</p><p>Fully Customizable / Material Variations</p><p>Texture Sizes:</p><p> 4096 / 2048</p><p>Collision: Yes, automatically generated</p><p>Number of Meshes: 12</p><p>Number of Blueprints: 5</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 18</p><p>Number of Textures: 58</p><p>Supported Unreal Engine Versions: 4.22 , 4.23 , 4.24 , 4.25 , 4.26 , 4.27+ , UE5</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Leartes Studios"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "stylizedpiratetavernmodularpiratepiratetavernstylised": {"human_name": "Stylized Pirate Tavern (Modular) ( Pirate , Pirate , Tavern , Stylised )", "machine_name": "stylizedpiratetavernmodularpiratepiratetavernstylised", "youtube_link": "XZ4ihaofVu8", "callout": "MSRP: $80", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Leartes Studios", "publisher-url": "https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>HERE, YOU CAN CHECK OUR NEW ASSET PLATFORM AND GRAB SOME FREE ENVIRONMENT PACKS</p><p>https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/</p><p>Stylized Pirate Tavern</p><p>This is a high-quality, modular asset pack that includes a wide variety of easy-to-assemble modular building assets and high-quality props.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
