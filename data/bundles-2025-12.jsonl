Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

These flames stay for a period of time, burning any opponents who come in contact with them.</li>\n<li>FIRE AMP - When an opponent is burning, Zetterburn's Strong Attacks can absorb the flames and launch the burned enemy twice as far, making for an effective killing blow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Orcane is a playful trickster, notorious for escaping even the most precarious of situations. He can transform into water and confuse enemies with a spray of bubbles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PUDDLE TELEPORTATION - Orcane creates a puddle with his Neutral Special or Down Special. He can then teleport to his puddle using his Up Special as a powerful vertical blow or an effective recovery when launched off the stage.</li>\n<li>BUBBLE EVAPORATION - Orcane can turn his puddle into a pillar of bubbles with his Down Special to trap enemies above the puddle.</li>\n<li>WATER AMP - When standing on top of his puddle, Orcane can consume the water underneath him to perform powerful Strong Attacks with far greater range and knockback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The youngest trainee in the history of the Air Academy, Wrastor has never lived by anyone's rules but his own.

Deliberate and loyal, he is one of the infamous Wall Runners who patrol the Rock Wall. Unlike other Wall Runners, Kragg has the legendary ability to control the earth with his will.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ROCK HURL - Kragg can pull a rock out of the ground and hurl it at opponents. After it leaves his hands, the rock becomes a solid piece of stage that either Kragg or other players can break.</li>\n<li>DEFENSE BALL - Kragg can curl into a ball and roll toward enemies. Although he can be damaged while in ball form, he cannot be knocked away.</li>\n<li>EARTH PILLAR - Kragg can summon a pillar of earth to his feet regardless of where he is. If Kragg is about to fall to his death, this move can quickly turn his situation around.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forsburn is the disgraced, eldest son of the Firelands' ruling family. After being condemned by the Fire Council and his own brother, Forsburn found refuge in a group of outsiders who had rejected the flame and mastered the way of smoke.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SMOKE SCREEN - Forsburn can use his Neutral Special to obscure the battlefield allowing Forsburn to remain hidden inside a cloud of smoke.</li>\n<li>DECOY - Through his Forward Special, Forsburn can create a smoke facsimile of himself that can attack opponents. The illusory Forsburn breaks into smoke after being hit by a single attack.</li>\n<li>CONSUME/COMBUST - By using his Down Special, Forsburn can consume his smoke clouds back into his body. After consuming three clouds, Forsburn is charged up and can use Down Special again to combust: knocking opponents away at high speed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest. She commands fearful respect throughout the forest for her unhesitating vigilantism. She uses her agility to trap any unknown intruders before they even realize she is there.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WATCHER'S MARK - Maypul can use her Seeds or her Watcher's Dash to mark opponents, making them susceptible to her following attacks.</li>\n<li>WRAPPED UP - After marking her targets, Maypul can use her Strong Attacks or her trusty Plant to wrap marked opponents in place allowing her to follow up with another attack.</li>\n<li>SLING SHOT - Maypul can use her vines to sling toward marked opponents, allowing her to elude attacks and quickly close distances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Absa is a famed engineer and martialist of the Elders of the Air Alliance. Despite the laws of the Elders, Absa secretly developed storm techniques in the caves of the Archai mountains.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CLOUD CONTROL - Absa can place a cloud using her Neutral or Forward Special. This cloud hangs in the air until Absa bursts it by tapping her Neutral Special and knocking enemies away.</li>\n<li>THUNDER BOLT - Absa can charge her Neutral Special to create a powerful lightning blast that connects her to her cloud. All opponents caught between the two will be knocked away at high speeds.</li>\n<li>CONDENSED STORM - Absa focuses the power of a lightning bolt to the tip of her hoof. If she can line up one of her aerial kicks perfectly, she unleashes great power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Etalus is a legendary warrior in his native land.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
