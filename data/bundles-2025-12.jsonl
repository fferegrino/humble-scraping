Featuring the most popular and distinctive species ; including garden birds, exotic birds, birds of prey, water birds, flightless birds and more ; each pattern wings its way to you with step-by-step instructions and full-size templates, making them perfect for all abilities. The finished little birdies would make cute brooches, bag charms and home accessories, or can even be scaled up to make bigger plushes, all of which will make your friends into avid twitchers! Author Alison J Reid has spent months brooding away in her studio, researching all different kinds of birds, both common and rare. She has checked out their shapes, plumage and markings, and spent so much time trying to perfect their colourful, beautiful wings. It became an obsession! It was only by researching the various details that make each breed so distinctive, that Alison has been able to capture each of their unique qualities and differences. Pattern, colour and shape are key, so capturing these details in felt was important. Luckily, there are so many different colours of felt available! Felt's non-fraying, double sided, robust qualities make it easy to create all the little details that make each bird design so unique and instantly recognisable. Each bird pattern can be traced straight from the page (or enlarged if you want to sew a larger plush), and simple instructions mean that even beginners can get started. And because all the birds are sewn by hand, you don't need a sewing machine and can sit out in the garden with the birds while you sew. Whether you choose to sew just your own favourites, or make gifts for the other bird-lovers in your life, this book will provide hours of fun and inspiration.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Reid, Alison J"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "storybooktoys": {"human_name": "Storybook Toys", "machine_name": "storybooktoys", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "C&T Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Make a cherished companion for your little one Inspired by vintage patterns from the 1940s, these 16 projects include loveable dolls and softies, pillows, puppets, and even a little girl's first handbag.

Ira Rott is well known for her gorgeous animal designs and her easy-to-follow crochet patterns, which include step-by-step photographs for any fiddly parts, and crochet charts alongside the written patterns. She expertly guides you through making three different kinds of crochet slippers ; shoes with covered heels, boots with ankle cuffs, and slides which are backless slippers. Knowing what size to make is made easy thanks to a clever measuring chart at the front of the book. Simply open the flap, put your foot on the measuring gauge and instantly see what size you need. In the book are useful tables that show how much yarn and what size hook you will need for each size. Complete step-by-step instructions and charts then show you how to master each slipper type, with templates for adding non-slip soles to your crochet slippers too. Once you've mastered the slipper-making, the fun begins in creating your crochet animal designs. Choose from: the Snuggly Pug, the Cuddly Bear, the Happy Penguin, the Zingy Dinosaur, the Starry Unicorn, the Rock 'n' Roll Panda, the Sleepy Koala, the Mossy Sloth. the Graceful Elephant, the Playful Pig, the Mischievous Raccoon, the Cheeky Monkey, the Woolly Sheep, the Sandy Turtle, the Sassy Cat, the Hippie Llama, the Brave Moose, the Artful Fox, the Friendly Cow and the Roaring Lion. But that's not all ; Ira also shows you how you can mix and match patterns to create all sorts of new animals too. Add the unicorn horn to the cat for a cute uni-kitty, and mix the dinosaur and the penguin to create a wise owl ; once you've discovered that you can customize your crochet slippers you'll be able to create unlimited options!</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Rott, Ira"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "knittedtoytales": {"human_name": "Knitted Toy Tales", "machine_name": "knittedtoytales", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "David & Charles", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>This guide features more than twenty adorable and easy-to-make toy knitting projects\u2014from bunnies and bears to Russian dolls and robots.In Knitted ToyT ales, Laura Long introduces a menagerie of little knitted characters such as Frederick the Frog Prince, Eddie the Friendly Elephant, and The Owl and the Pussycat.Packed with personality and individual charm, these softly colored characters are a joy to knit.

Cats? But they're all the same, aren't they? Well, no not really! When you start to explore the many different breeds of cats, you realise just what a variety of breeds there is, and how different they are from each other. Author Alison J Reid has spent months beavering away in her studio, researching all different kinds of cats, both domestic and wild. She has checked out their colourings and markings, and spent so much time trying to perfect their colourful, beautiful eyes. It became an obsession! It was only by researching the various details that make each breed so distinctive, that Alison has been able to capture each of their unique qualities and differences. Pattern, colour and shape are key, so capturing these details in felt was important. Luckily, there are so many different colours of felt available, including fur-like mottled effects. Felt's non-fraying, double sided, robust qualities make it easy to create all the little details that make each cat breed so unique and instantly recognisable. She has also used small amounts of wool curls and roving to add texture for truly strokable results. Each cat pattern can be traced straight from the page (or enlarged if you want to sew a larger plush), and simple instructions mean that even beginners can get started. And because all the cats are sewn by hand, you don't need a sewing machine and can sit on the sofa with your cat while you sew. Whether you choose to sew just your own favourites, or make cats for the other crazy cat people in your life, this book will provide hours of fun and inspiration.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Reid, Alison J"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "cuddlebuddiesanimalsoftiepattern": {"human_name": "Cuddle Buddies Animal Softie Pattern", "machine_name": "cuddlebuddiesanimalsoftiepattern", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "C&T Publishing", "publisher-url": "https://openroadmedia.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 18.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>5 squeezable BFFs to warm your heart Snuggable, huggable, and tons of fun to sew!

Wind, the sole restless sentinel, howled through shattered windowpanes, weaving sorrowful moans among the hollow houses. A silhouette, cloaked in the hush of the night, stepped across the overgrown threshold, boots kicking up whispers of dust where forgotten laughter once danced. Each creak of a floorboard, each rustle of unseen leaves, was a whispered dare thrown at the face of the unknown. In this village, where moonlight carved shadows into phantoms, a dance of courage and curiosity was about to unfold, etched not on moonlit stone but on the canvas of a heart unafraid to defy the whispers of the wind.</p><p>Creative Direction by Leartes Team, Environment made by talented Artist \u201cLucas Henrique\u201d </p><p>Technical Details</p><p>Features:</p><p>294 Unique Meshes</p><p>Attention to Detail / AAA Quality</p><p>Controllable parameters in Material Instances</p><p>High-Quality Assets</p><p>Game ready/Optimized</p><p>Unique Concepts of Assets</p><p>High Attention to Details</p><p>Material Variations For Some Assets</p><p>Texture Sizes:</p><p>4096</p><p>2048</p><p>1024</p><p>Texture Size: 4096 for detailed Assets, 2048 for Mid sized Assets, &amp; 1024 for small assets</p><p>Collision: Yes, Custom collisions for complex assets</p><p>LODs: Yes, 4 LODs for complex assets</p><p>Number of Meshes: 294 Unique Meshes</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 108</p><p>Number of Textures: 209</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: All Platforms</p><p>Supported Development Versions: Unreal Engine 5.3</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Leartes Studios", "developer-url": "https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/products/the-aftermath"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "policecharacterandnpc": {"human_name": "Police Character / NPC", "machine_name": "policecharacterandnpc", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "MSRP: $20", "publishers": [], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Police Character / NPC / High Quality / Fully Rigged / Ready for Mannequin Animations.</p><p>The Character is made according to Unreal Engine Mannequin Skeleton and all ready animations will work with it.</p><p>Technical Details</p><p>Features:</p><p>Rigged</p><p>Good to use in Games / Virtual Productions</p><p>Customizable Clothes</p><p>Game ready/Optimized</p><p>Fully Customizable / Material Variations</p><p>Texture Sizes:</p><p> 4096 / 2048</p><p>Collision: Yes, automatically generated</p><p>Number of Meshes: 12</p><p>Number of Blueprints: 5</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 18</p><p>Number of Textures: 58</p><p>Supported Unreal Engine Versions: 4.22 , 4.23 , 4.24 , 4.25 , 4.26 , 4.27+ , UE5</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Leartes Studios"}], "item_content_type": "software"}, "stylizedpiratetavernmodularpiratepiratetavernstylised": {"human_name": "Stylized Pirate Tavern (Modular) ( Pirate , Pirate , Tavern , Stylised )", "machine_name": "stylizedpiratetavernmodularpiratepiratetavernstylised", "youtube_link": "XZ4ihaofVu8", "callout": "MSRP: $80", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Leartes Studios", "publisher-url": "https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 30.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>HERE, YOU CAN CHECK OUR NEW ASSET PLATFORM AND GRAB SOME FREE ENVIRONMENT PACKS</p><p>https://cosmos.leartesstudios.com/</p><p>Stylized Pirate Tavern</p><p>This is a high-quality, modular asset pack that includes a wide variety of easy-to-assemble modular building assets and high-quality props.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.

Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease (PD) through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today. PD affects nearly 1 million people in the United States and more than 6 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by 2040 as the population ages and becomes at increasing risk for neurologic disorders. There is no known cure and the need for new Parkinson\u2019s treatments has never been more critical.</p>\n<p>From inception, MJFF has worked to jolt Parkinson\u2019s drug development out of a standstill. Our activities go far beyond funding basic research discoveries. We identify and fund innovative ideas in Parkinson\u2019s disease discovery, including high-risk, high-reward opportunities; an approach that in less than two decades has transformed the broader approach in the Parkinson\u2019s research field. We laser-focus on the targets that show real potential to help people, and proactively chaperone them along the complicated pipeline toward clinical trials. Positioned at the global nexus of Parkinson\u2019s research, we strive to set the standard for impact and accountability. We constantly monitor costs to maximize the value of the philanthropic support we receive. As a result, since our founding, 88 cents of every dollar we spend goes straight to our research programs.</p>\n<p>Curing Parkinson\u2019s is ambitious and we can\u2019t do it alone.
