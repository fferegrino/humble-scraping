While problematic, these campaigns are often limited in frequency and scale because they require human interaction to establish rapport with their victims. These campaigns are also limited in effectiveness, since many of the fraudsters are targeting victims in their non-native language - as these campaigns are often perpetrated by organized criminal enterprises exploiting low-income workers in under-developed countries.\u00a0 In the wake of the growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) explosion, these limiting factors are quickly dissolving and the threat landscape is rapidly changing. We are already beginning to see signs of cyber adversaries adopting the use of AI in their campaigns. Assuming this trend continues, social engineering campaigns are on track to become larger, more frequent, and far more effective as criminal enterprises begin to replace human fraudsters with objective-driven, and fully autonomous social engineering systems built on top of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Building on over a decade of research in using conversational AI for social engineering, this book will address how recent advances in LLM and generative AI technology can empower threat actors to execute fully automated social engineering attacks at a near limitless scale.\u00a0 Through the increased scaling of LLMs, we have effectively equipped machines with natural language (i.e., with our language). The world is rapidly pivoting away from the use of obscure machine languages that required deliberate human effort to support system interactions. The new interface to interact with these systems (and them with us), is the same languages and the same methods of communication that we use to interact with one another. By speaking their language, humans have hacked machines for decades. But now, with the machines speaking our language, the era where machines will hack humans is upon us.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Hutchens", "developer-url": "http://www.wiley.com/en-us/search?pq=1394222548"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "howirobbanks_andothersuchplaces": {"human_name": "How I Rob Banks: And Other Such Places", "machine_name": "howirobbanks_andothersuchplaces", "youtube_link": null, "callout": null, "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Wiley", "publisher-url": "http://www.wiley.com/en-us/search?pq=1119911478"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 1.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p>Cybersecurity is often thought of as being about technology.

This applies both to\u00a0 technology-agnostic design issues affecting areas like\u00a0 authentication and business logic, and also to many\u00a0 technology-specific areas such as code injection.

She aims to bring him and the old gods back to their former glory, caring little that their ascendance will also mean an end to the human race. However, awakening the Leviathan is no small feat.

She's also been saddled with the companionship of her farm-raised cousin Nia. Eventually, Bernice's disenchantment gives way to rage, which in turn leads her to commit a deadly crime. When Nia won't cover for Bernice's actions, she turns on Nia, chasing her into the deadly coastal waves.But the timing is right and the elementals have better ideas: the moment the girls go under, Bernice is commandeered for Arahab's task force, and Nia is turned into a strange and powerful new creature by a servant of the earth who doesn't want to surrender his green fields and muddy plains\u2014not yet, at least.

Among the City's children was Pytheas, secretly the god Apollo in human form.Sixty years ago, the Just City schismed into five cities, each devoted to a different version of the original vision.Forty years ago, the five cities managed to bring their squabbles to a close. But in consequence of their struggle, their existence finally came to the attention of Zeus, who can't allow them to remain in deep antiquity, changing the course of human history. Convinced by Apollo to spare the Cities, Zeus instead moved everything on the island to the planet Plato, circling its own distant sun.Now, more than a generation has passed. The Cities are flourishing on Plato, and even trading with multiple alien species. Then, on the same day, two things happen.

On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.</p><p>Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard - and the heretical Theophages - are lost to antiquity.</p><p>But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.</p><p>Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand. Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or - like so many others before - will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?</p><p>The boxed set is bursting with the puzzles, foes, and magic only found in a DCC RPG adventure. Inside you will find the God Eaters' grand alchymical experiment, with its spinning alembic and rotating elemental spheres. This takes the form of a large game board, approximately 17\" x 22\", with four separate spinning maps that attach to the board. An adventure booklet of 112 pages provides hitherto unknown monsters, perils, and traps. These lurk in the forgotten corridors, certain to bring a quick end to overconfident explorers.</p><p>Players will have the opportunity to study and manipulate the fabled Alembic Key, a relic rife with Theophagic sigils and zodiac signs. But beware, foolhardy reavers! Rotating the key spins the dungeon, transforming the PCs and altering reality itself! Left in the hands of a fidgety player, it could easily spell the end of the multiverse. This physical prop is composed of two spinning dials and is used by players during the adventure.</p><p>And as befitting DCC #100, the adventure is replete with player handouts in the form of a 28-page booklet containing over 40 illustrations of the Alembic, its elemental spheres, and the terrors lurking within the dark halls, as well as the infamous Sheaves of Chaos.</p><p>Finally, any adventure is only as good as the judge running it. Music of the Spheres is Chaos was designed with the judge in mind. The boxed set includes the Bookmark of 4 Parts - a tool for referencing the PCs' own changes.</p><p>This Boxed Set includes:</p><p>- Adventure Booklet (112 pages)</p><p>- Player Handout Booklet (28 pages and more than 40 illustrations)</p><p>- Large 17\" x 22\" Gameboard and four separate Spinning Maps</p><p>- Double-sided bookmark of 4 Parts (to track changes imposed by the Spinning Map)</p><p>- Alembic Key prop (used by players to spin the dungeon!)</p><p>- 3 Sheaves of Chaos handouts</p><p>With its many unique components, Music of the Spheres is Chaos captures all the magic and wonder that you've come to expect from a DCC RPG adventure. But fans familiar with Harley Stroh's work in Legacy of the Savage Kings, Sailors on the Starless Sea, and his many other adventures will know that our adventures are always far more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>You won't mistake this dungeon for any other adventure, anywhere, ever.</p><p>Be sure to check out our complete coverage of DCC #100 The Music of the Spheres is Chaos on www.goodman-games.com! From videos to liveplays to deep dives to Harley Stroh's own design diaries, there is a wealth of information about this innovative adventure!
