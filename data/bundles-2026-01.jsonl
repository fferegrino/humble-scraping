And proving he can lend a hand, too, Lone Wolf Ogami pulls someone to safety as well \u2014 but maybe he should have let him drown. Eventually, the two opposing master swordsmen dry off and go head to head in a sword fight of a thousand stances and couple of days length. This seems like it could be the deciding bout between the two, unless that nasty, Abeno Kaii gets in the way, and he seems to do that a lot lately.The true meaning of Bushido, the warrior code, oozes from every page of this volume. A little boy desperately attempts to drag his ronin father to safely, even if it costs him his own life; that same wandering samurai and his mortal enemy work together to save the frostbitten fingers of the same little boy, knowing they will eventually match swords again in a battle to the death; another samurai bites his own tongue, killing himself and locking a dark secret in his grave. The code of the samurai is complex and rich with irony, which is why so few carry this code through life. But as we draw closer to the conclusion of this epic struggle, the true bushi are stepping forth and showing their colors. It will truly be a fight to the finish. So, in these final days, a ronin and his young boy will visit the grave of their murdered wife and mother.

On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.</p><p>Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard - and the heretical Theophages - are lost to antiquity.</p><p>But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.</p><p>Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand. Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or - like so many others before - will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?</p><p>The boxed set is bursting with the puzzles, foes, and magic only found in a DCC RPG adventure. Inside you will find the God Eaters' grand alchymical experiment, with its spinning alembic and rotating elemental spheres. This takes the form of a large game board, approximately 17\" x 22\", with four separate spinning maps that attach to the board. An adventure booklet of 112 pages provides hitherto unknown monsters, perils, and traps. These lurk in the forgotten corridors, certain to bring a quick end to overconfident explorers.</p><p>Players will have the opportunity to study and manipulate the fabled Alembic Key, a relic rife with Theophagic sigils and zodiac signs. But beware, foolhardy reavers! Rotating the key spins the dungeon, transforming the PCs and altering reality itself! Left in the hands of a fidgety player, it could easily spell the end of the multiverse. This physical prop is composed of two spinning dials and is used by players during the adventure.</p><p>And as befitting DCC #100, the adventure is replete with player handouts in the form of a 28-page booklet containing over 40 illustrations of the Alembic, its elemental spheres, and the terrors lurking within the dark halls, as well as the infamous Sheaves of Chaos.</p><p>Finally, any adventure is only as good as the judge running it. Music of the Spheres is Chaos was designed with the judge in mind. The boxed set includes the Bookmark of 4 Parts - a tool for referencing the PCs' own changes.</p><p>This Boxed Set includes:</p><p>- Adventure Booklet (112 pages)</p><p>- Player Handout Booklet (28 pages and more than 40 illustrations)</p><p>- Large 17\" x 22\" Gameboard and four separate Spinning Maps</p><p>- Double-sided bookmark of 4 Parts (to track changes imposed by the Spinning Map)</p><p>- Alembic Key prop (used by players to spin the dungeon!)</p><p>- 3 Sheaves of Chaos handouts</p><p>With its many unique components, Music of the Spheres is Chaos captures all the magic and wonder that you've come to expect from a DCC RPG adventure. But fans familiar with Harley Stroh's work in Legacy of the Savage Kings, Sailors on the Starless Sea, and his many other adventures will know that our adventures are always far more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>You won't mistake this dungeon for any other adventure, anywhere, ever.</p><p>Be sure to check out our complete coverage of DCC #100 The Music of the Spheres is Chaos on www.goodman-games.com! From videos to liveplays to deep dives to Harley Stroh's own design diaries, there is a wealth of information about this innovative adventure!
