Maybe you will even find new love, one transcending time itself.\n<br>\n<br>\nDLC #5\n<br>\nThis new standalone campaign picks up where the \u201cThrough the Ashes\u201d story left off.

With the Knight Commander busy elsewhere, what can a group of regular adventurers with no mythic powers do to save the day? This expansion offers a 6-7 hourlong story which you can play independently or with the hero from your \u201cThrough the Ashes\u201d savegame. And when you're done, a whole new dungeon in the main campaign will be open for the Knight Commander to explore.\n<br>\n<br>\nDLC #6\n<br>\nDuring your first visit to Kenabres, things did not go well. Now that the demonic assault has been thwarted, and the crusaders are preparing their final counterattack, why not take a little break? Kenabres, burned and rebuilt, is holding a new festival, and the Knight Commander will be the guest of honor. This is your chance to spend some quality time away from the battlefields together with your companions \u2013 and, perhaps, go on a special date with your loved one.

Another brilliant and hilarious Discworld adventure from beloved New York Times bestselling author Terry Pratchett For Commander Sam Vimes, Head of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, life consists of trouble . . . and more trouble: a werewolf with pre-lunar tension, a dwarf with attitude, a golem who\u2019s begun to think for itself. Now he\u2019s got the unusual deaths of three elderly Ankh-Morporkians on his hands. It\u2019s murder in Discworld!\u2014which ordinarily is no big deal. The problem is, the deaths do not bear the clean, efficient marks of the Assassins' Guild;there\u2019s an apparent lack of motive, and there\u2019s no trace of anything alive having been at the crime scene. What Vimes does have are some tracks of white clay and more bothersome \u201cclue\u201d thingies that muck up his investigations. The anger of a fearful populace is already targeting the city\u2019s small community of golems\u2014those mindless, absurdly industrious creatures of baked clay, who can occasionally be found toiling in the city's factories. And certain highly placed personages are using the unrest as an excuse to resurrect a monarchy\u2014which would be bad enough even if their would-be \u201cking\u201d wasn\u2019t as empty-headed as your typical animated pottery.

The .22LR\u2019s low recoil and superb design makes this rifle a perfect starting point for people learning the basics of shooting. <br><br><strong> Small Game Hunting: </strong> <br>In addition to it\u2019s low recoil, this semi-automatic rifle allows you to fire multiple small rounds, making it a great choice for rabbit hunting and target practice. Perfect for Jackrabbits and other small game, the Virant is not used to hunt larger animals. <br><br><strong> Sight Compatibility:</strong><br>By default you can use the Virant\u2019s iron sight: However, for improved aiming at a distance this rifle supports multiple scope attachments: Red Dot Sight, 1-4x24mm Rifle Scope, 4-8x42mm Rifle Scope, and 8-16x50mm Rifle Scope. <br><br><strong> Klasika and Express:</strong><br>The Virant .22LR Semi-Automatic Rifle comes in two different different color variations: Klasika and Express. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Crosspoint CB-165:</strong><br>With 165 foot-pounds of draw weight, this precision-crafted crossbow sports enough power to take down even the largest game animals. With a beautiful woven carbon fiber barrel, a built-in rope-cocking device, and a 4-arrow quiver, the Crosspoint CB-165 is ideal for short-range hunting. <br><br><strong> Hawken 1-5X30 Crossbow Scope:</strong><br>This premium scope is designed for crossbows shooting 300 feet per second or faster. With three duplex crosshairs and variable zoom settings up to 5x, this is the perfect crossbow scope for any situation. <br><br><strong> Range and Power: </strong> <br>The Crosspoint CB-165 Crossbow is more powerful and offers greater range than any other bow currently in the store. However, as with everything in hunting, it\u2019s a trade-off. This crossbow is rather large and heavy, requiring significant space in your backpack. Additionally, reloading the crossbow is slower than most other weapons so make sure you make each shot count! <br><br><strong> Classic, Arctic, Dark Star &amp; Warden:</strong><br>The Crosspoint CB-165 comes in four different different color variations; Classic, Arctic, Dark Star and Warden. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Houyi Recurve Bow:</strong><br>In Chinese mythology, when 10 suns rose from Earth and turned the world into a barren wasteland, the archer Houy shot down 9 of the 10 suns, leaving only the last one. This bow takes its name from that myth. Based on the designs of traditional Chinese Qing recurve bows, the Houyi Recurve Bow has ample penetration power and can take down medium game at short ranges. <br><br><strong> Spook fewer animals in your surroundings: </strong> <br>This recurve bow gives you an unparalleled advantage compared to rifles, handguns, shotguns or even crossbows. When taking a shot, the longbow is much quieter and will spook a smaller number of animals within a limited radius. But as always, this is a trade-off; although the longbow is currently the quietest weapon in the game, it offers limited range compared to many other weapons. <br><br><strong> Hidden Dragon, Moonlight, Snakeskin and Default:</strong><br>The Houyi Recurve Bow comes in four different different color variations: Default, Hidden Dragon, Moonlight and Snakeskin.", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Expansive Worlds", "developer-url": "https://avalanchestudios.com/"}], "item_content_type": "game"}, "thehunter_callofthewild_weaponpack3": {"human_name": "theHunter: Call of the Wild - Weapon Pack 3", "machine_name": "thehunter_callofthewild_weaponpack3", "youtube_link": "VGOTYfGMyoE", "callout": "Weapon Pack 3: Vasquez Cyclone .45, Eckers .30-06, Andersson .22LR", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Avalanche Studios"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 15.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "The wardens have just sent word that a new shipment has been delivered, containing quality hunting weapons like the Eckers .30-06 Bolt-Action Rifle, the Vasquez Cyclone .45 Big Bore Air Rifle, and the Andersson .22LR Semi-automatic Pistol. <strong class=\"hmb\"> <br><br>Vasquez Cyclone .45 Big Bore Air Rifle:</strong><br>The Vasquez Cyclone is the poster child for a new generation of big bore air rifles.

Upon finding a target, it will \u2018point' in that direction and await your command before pouncing to flush out the animal. <br><br>\u2022 Point M (medium game): Keeping its distance from you yet staying close enough so that its \u2018point' can still be seen, the dog searches for animals within a wider radius. Game of this size will eventually flee if the dog \u2018points' at them for too long, so make sure to always keep a good eye on your companion. <br><br>\u2022 Point L (large game): For larger animals that won't be intimidated by the dog's presence, it will roam within a very large radius. It will signal to you when a scent has been found, guiding you in its direction. <br><br>\u2022 Spot Point: The dog will advance towards and \u2018point' at an animal which has already been \u2018spotted' by you. <br><br>\u2022 Point Species (trait): Shortly after encountering animal tracks or droppings, you can direct your dog to search for the particular species that left the clue. <br><br><strong> Train your expert hunting dog </strong> <br>Players who already own the Bloodhound or the Labrador Retriever are in for a real treat. Through a free new update available for all dog owners, you can customize your very own expert hunting dog by enhancing one dog with the skills of two.

As the PCs navigate the challenges of exploring the canyon, battling mutant rattlesnakes, conducting diplomatic talks, and deciding how they deal with moral questions, they will have to weigh the consequences of their actions and ultimately decide the fate of Skull Canyon\u2019s unusual inhabitants.</p></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><p>The Showdown in Skull Canyon PDF features:</p></p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><p>A 28-page adventure in three acts for character levels 1-5.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Explore the mysterious Skull Canyon and interact with its unusual inhabitants.</p></li><li><p>Investigate the growing tensions between the NCR Rangers and the mutants.</p></li><li><p>Choose a side and/or help resolve the dispute.</p></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><p>This PDF requires the core rules found in the Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook but could be played using the rules and pregen characters found in the Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Starter Set.</p></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><p>\u00a9 1997-2023 Bethesda Softworks LLC, a ZeniMax Media company.

Evidence of previous conflicts may lie nearby, along with the corpses of long-dead soldiers who once bore the technology that the Brotherhood has decided to reclaim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This 3D print product lets you print multiple pieces of scatter to help create immersive tabletop scenes. They could also be used to build defensible positions, dig sites, camping grounds, or to flesh out more densely populated areas. Although designed with the Brotherhood of Steel in mind, these items can easily be used or repurposed by any faction of the Wasteland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Files have been pre-hollowed where possible, and all files include supported versions for easier printing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contents&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Axe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Campfire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooking Fire Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooking Fire Grill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooking Fire Pole</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooking Fire Pot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stump</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stump With Axe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wood Pile</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Missile Pod L</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Missile Pod R</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Pipes 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Pipes 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Pipes 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Mount L</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Mount R</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Brace 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Brace 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Platform</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Sandbags Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AA Turret Sandbags Stairs&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade 4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade 5</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade Overturned Jeep Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade Overturned Jeep Seat 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade Overturned Jeep Seat 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade Overturned Jeep Seat 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barricade Overturned Jeep Windscreen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concrete Barricade</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Back Seat</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Body</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Driver Seat</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Front Suspension</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Passenger Seat</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Rear Suspension</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Spare Tire</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Steering Wheel</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Wheel 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Wheel 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Wheel 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Wheel 4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jeep Windscreen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ammo Pouch</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bed Frame</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bed Mattress</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Camp Stove</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Construction Light Floor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Construction Light Standing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dufflebag</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ham Radio</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metal Box</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pallet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Radio</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sleeping Bag</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Table</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Armored Plate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Brace 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Brace 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Platform</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Railing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Curved Wall</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Stairs Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Stairs Brace 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Stairs Brace 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Stairs Railing 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Stairs Railing 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Stairs Stairs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Armored Plate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Base</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Brace 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Brace 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Platform</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Railing 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Railing 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Railing Short</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Stairs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Straight Wall</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Corpse 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Corpse 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Corpse 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 1 Closed A</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 1 Closed B</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 1 Closed C</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 1 Open A</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 1 Open B</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 1 Open C</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Closed A</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Closed B</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Closed C</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Closed D</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Closed E</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Open A</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Open B</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Open C</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Open D</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 2 Open E</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent 4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Large 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Large 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Large 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Large 4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Large 5</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Large 6</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Small 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Small 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Small 3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tent Floor Small 4</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [], "item_content_type": null}, "fallout_wastelandwarfare_terrainexpansion_vaultatriumpackstl": {"human_name": "Fallout: Wasteland Warfare -

Saved only by forming an unusual bond with the enigmatic beasts who roam the ice, Sophie vows to stay hidden from the world, hoping she can heal. \n\nBut fate has other plans\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand Sophie's ensuing odyssey and the ragtag family she finds will change the entire world.\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Charlie Jane Anders"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "autonomous": {"human_name": "Autonomous", "machine_name": "autonomous", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">Winner of the 2018 Lambda Literary Award</div>", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Books", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 3.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><b>\"</b><i><b>Autonomous</b></i><b> is to biotech and AI what </b><i><b>Neuromancer </b></i><b>was to the Internet.\"\u201a\u00c4\u00eeNeal Stephenson</b>\n\n<b>\"Something genuinely and thrillingly new in the naturalistic, subjective, paradoxically humanistic but non-anthropomorphic depiction of bot-POV\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand all in the service of vivid, solid storytelling.\"\u201a\u00c4\u00eeWilliam Gibson</b>\n\n<i>When anything can be owned, how can we be free?</i>\n\nEarth, 2144. Jack is an anti-patent scientist turned drug pirate, traversing the world in a submarine as a pharmaceutical Robin Hood, fabricating cheap scrips for poor people who can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t otherwise afford them. But her latest drug hack has left a trail of lethal overdoses as people become addicted to their work, doing repetitive tasks until they become unsafe or insane.\n\nHot on her trail, an unlikely pair: Eliasz, a brooding military agent, and his robotic partner, Paladin. As they race to stop information about the sinister origins of Jack\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s drug from getting out, they begin to form an uncommonly close bond that neither of them fully understand.\n\nAnd underlying it all is one fundamental question: Is freedom possible in a culture where everything, even people, can be owned?\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Annalee Newitz"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"miss_major_alexander_l_lee_tgijp_black_trans_cultural_center": {"machine_name": "miss_major_alexander_l_lee_tgijp_black_trans_cultural_center", "youtube_link": null, "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<span><span><em>Donations to support&nbsp;</em></span></span>Miss Major Alexander L.
