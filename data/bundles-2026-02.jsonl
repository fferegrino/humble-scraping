And from there, it's easy to control our entire lives.\"</i>\n\nJanuary is a dying planet\u201a\u00c4\u00eedivided between a permanently frozen darkness on one side, and blazing endless sunshine on the other. Humanity clings to life, spread across two archaic cities built in the sliver of habitable dusk.\n\nBut life inside the cities is just as dangerous as the uninhabitable wastelands outside.\n\nSophie, a student and reluctant revolutionary, is supposed to be dead after being exiled into the night. Saved only by forming an unusual bond with the enigmatic beasts who roam the ice, Sophie vows to stay hidden from the world, hoping she can heal. \n\nBut fate has other plans\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand Sophie's ensuing odyssey and the ragtag family she finds will change the entire world.\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Charlie Jane Anders"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}, "autonomous": {"human_name": "Autonomous", "machine_name": "autonomous", "youtube_link": null, "callout": "<div class=\"accolades\">Winner of the 2018 Lambda Literary Award</div>", "publishers": [{"publisher-name": "Tor Books", "publisher-url": "https://torpublishinggroup.com/"}], "side_box_art_text": null, "third_party_subscribe_text": null, "msrp_price": null, "min_price|money": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 3.0}, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<p><b>\"</b><i><b>Autonomous</b></i><b> is to biotech and AI what </b><i><b>Neuromancer </b></i><b>was to the Internet.\"\u201a\u00c4\u00eeNeal Stephenson</b>\n\n<b>\"Something genuinely and thrillingly new in the naturalistic, subjective, paradoxically humanistic but non-anthropomorphic depiction of bot-POV\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand all in the service of vivid, solid storytelling.\"\u201a\u00c4\u00eeWilliam Gibson</b>\n\n<i>When anything can be owned, how can we be free?</i>\n\nEarth, 2144. Jack is an anti-patent scientist turned drug pirate, traversing the world in a submarine as a pharmaceutical Robin Hood, fabricating cheap scrips for poor people who can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t otherwise afford them. But her latest drug hack has left a trail of lethal overdoses as people become addicted to their work, doing repetitive tasks until they become unsafe or insane.\n\nHot on her trail, an unlikely pair: Eliasz, a brooding military agent, and his robotic partner, Paladin. As they race to stop information about the sinister origins of Jack\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s drug from getting out, they begin to form an uncommonly close bond that neither of them fully understand.\n\nAnd underlying it all is one fundamental question: Is freedom possible in a culture where everything, even people, can be owned?\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>", "user_ratings": {}, "developers": [{"developer-name": "Annalee Newitz"}], "item_content_type": "ebook"}}, "charity_data": {"charity_items": {"miss_major_alexander_l_lee_tgijp_black_trans_cultural_center": {"machine_name": "miss_major_alexander_l_lee_tgijp_black_trans_cultural_center", "youtube_link": null, "item_content_type": null, "subtitle_html": null, "description_text": "<span><span><em>Donations to support&nbsp;</em></span></span>Miss Major Alexander L.
